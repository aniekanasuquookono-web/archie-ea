"""Add organization_id to arb_change_requests (ChangeRequest).

PR 297 defects 2-3 (note 970): ArchitectureChangeImpactService and the
Phase H change-management routes have no column to tenant-fence
ChangeRequest on at all. Backfills from arb_review_item_id's own
organization_id where a change request links to a review item (the
only existing path from a ChangeRequest to a tenant); a request with no
review item has no derivable tenant and is left NULL rather than
guessed.

The column is only tightened to NOT NULL when the backfill actually
reached every row -- on a database with rows that have no review item,
it stays nullable and the application-side fencing treats a NULL
organization_id the same way the rest of the tenant-isolation layer
treats "no tenant context": excluded from a tenant-scoped query, never
returned to the wrong tenant.

Idempotent: guards the column add, the backfill and the NOT NULL step
so a second run is a no-op.

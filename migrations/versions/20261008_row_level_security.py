"""Row-level security on the tenant and shared-catalogue tables (R1-B20 PR 3).

PostgreSQL itself refuses a query that forgets the organisation: the database
role the application runs as (``archie_runtime``) sees and changes only the
session organisation's rows, and shared catalogue rows read-only. This is the
second enforcement layer behind the ORM filter in
``app/middleware/tenant_isolation.py``; the session organisation it reads is
the one that module already sets for every transaction.

Re-land of the reverted #364 / held #423, rewritten to the decisions in the
R1-B20 PR 3 brief:

* One revision. No role creation, no grants, no default privileges: access
  grants stay with ``scripts/database/configure_roles.py``.
* ``ENABLE`` row-level security, not ``FORCE``. The deploy role
  (``archie_deploy``) owns the tables, so it is exempt and ``schema-upgrade``
  and every ``backfill-*`` command in ``deploy-schema.sh`` keep working.
  ``archie_runtime`` is not the owner and does not bypass row security, so every policy
  applies to it.
* The policies compare against ``NULLIF(current_setting(..., true), '')``:
  a connection that previously ran a transaction with the setting returns
  ``''`` (not NULL) and ``''::integer`` would raise. No context means NULL
  means zero rows, never an error.
* Each table is checked before it is touched (table present, ``organization_id``
  present, migration role may alter it). A table that fails a check is skipped
  with a printed reason and listed in the summary line; the deploy never fails
  on it. Alembic runs a revision once, so a table (or a late ``organization_id``
  column) that is not there when this revision runs is NOT picked up later: it
  needs its own new fencing revision, and the guard test in
  ``tests/test_row_level_security.py`` fails with "add a new fencing revision"
  when a ``TenantMixin`` / ``HybridTenantMixin`` table is in none of them.
* ``archie.platform_scope = 'on'`` is admitted by every policy. It is set only
  by ``app.jobs.tenant_safe_job.platform_scope`` for the few runtime paths that
  must read across organisations or resolve the organisation themselves.

Idempotent: every policy is dropped and recreated, so a re-run converges to
exactly these definitions. The migration imports nothing from ``app``.

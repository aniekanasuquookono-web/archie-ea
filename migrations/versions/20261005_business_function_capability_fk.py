"""Repoint business_function.capability_id's FK from business_capability.id
to unified_capabilities.id.

ensure_function() in
app/modules/applications/services/application_capability_catalog.py builds
every BusinessFunction it creates from a UnifiedCapability instance (via
walk() -> get_or_create_capability() -> UnifiedCapability), never a
BusinessCapability, and it is the ONLY code path that ever writes
business_function.capability_id. unified_capabilities is this codebase's
single source of truth for capability modeling; a BusinessFunction must
point at a row there. The old FK target let that write succeed only when a
UnifiedCapability.id happened to collide with a business_capability.id --
the two tables have independent id sequences, so this was not a reliable
coincidence, and the real shape of the bug was a ForeignKeyViolation the
first time it did not.

The important consequence: every existing business_function row's
capability_id is ALREADY a unified_capabilities.id. It only ever passed the
OLD FK by coincidence, because a Postgres FK check merely confirms the
integer value exists as some row's primary key in the referenced table --
it does not care which table conceptually "owns" that id space. There is
therefore no legacy-id-to-unified-id translation to perform here, and an
earlier version of this migration that attempted one via the
(source_table='business_capability', source_id) provenance lookup was
itself a data-corruption bug: it treated each row's already-correct
unified_capabilities.id as if it were a legacy business_capability.id
needing translation, and if any unified_capabilities row happened to have
a source_id matching that same numeric string -- plausible, since legacy
business_capability ids and unified_capabilities rows projected from
business_capability can easily have overlapping-looking id values -- the
UPDATE silently rewrote the row to point at a different, unrelated
capability. Its "unresolved rows" safety check ran AFTER that UPDATE had
already mutated the data, so it was validating the new, already-corrupted
values rather than the ones it was meant to guard.

This revision therefore does no UPDATE at all. It only validates that the
assumption above actually holds -- every business_function.capability_id is
already a valid unified_capabilities.id -- and repoints the FK. The
validation exists because a different, as-yet-undiscovered write path could
in principle have put a bad value in some row; it is not assumed away, it
is checked, and the migration fails loudly (a RuntimeError naming the
offending ids) rather than guessing or rewriting anything, matching this
file's own "don't guess, surface the gap" convention elsewhere
(app/models/business_capabilities.py's _project_capability_row,
app/commands/backfill_decision_register_consolidation.py's decision_ledger
orphan handling).

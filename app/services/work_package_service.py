"""The one work package writer (R1-B04 PR 2).

Every create, edit, delete and dependency change for a work package goes
through this module, onto the one canonical store ``UnifiedWorkPackage``
(``unified_work_packages``). Handlers in the roadmap, implementation planning,
ADM kanban and capability roadmap screens call these functions instead of
building their own rows.

Reuse check: this is the one writer of ``unified_work_packages``; a screen
that still writes one of the four retired stores is kept in step by the
transitional bridge (app/services/work_package_bridge.py) until R1-B04 PR 3
repoints it. The ownership writers in ``capability_ownership_service`` set the
pattern followed here: one module, organisation-fenced, raising a typed error a
route turns into a 404 or 400.

A "programme" is ``enterprise_initiative_id`` (the programme a work package
belongs to). A dependency is an id in ``work_dependencies``.

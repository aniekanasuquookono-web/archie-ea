"""AG-002: Architecture Compliance Matrix service.

Computes a per-application compliance scorecard using:
- ARBReviewItem status (latest review per application)
- ComplianceViolation count (per application)
- Scoring: approved=100, pending=50, rejected=0, conditional=75, default=60

All access is via ORM — no raw SQL.

        indistinguishable from a genuinely-measured zero violations and would

        badge). Returning ``None`` keeps that distinction — render it as "—",
        never as ``0``.

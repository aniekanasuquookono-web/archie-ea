"""
Application Pattern Classifier Service

Classifies each ApplicationComponent in the enterprise portfolio by architectural pattern
(monolith, modular_monolith, microservice, saas, legacy, api_gateway, unknown).

Classification uses the LLM (via LLMService) as the primary engine with a deterministic
rule-based fallback for when no LLM provider is configured.  Results are persisted to
ApplicationComponent.arch_pattern (added by SA-003).

Primary entry points:
  - classify_applications(app_ids=None) -> list[dict]
      Returns per-app classification records.
  - classify_portfolio(batch_size=50) -> dict
      Classifies the full portfolio in batches; returns aggregate statistics.

"""Transitional bridge: the four retired work package stores keep the one store in step.

R1-B04 PR 2 repoints the readers of work packages to ``unified_work_packages``
and the writers listed in the build notes to ``work_package_service``. A number
of other screens and services still create, edit and delete rows of the four
retired stores (``work_packages``, ``roadmap_work_packages``,
``implementation_work_packages``, ``technology_roadmap_initiatives``). Without
this module the repointed lists would miss every row such a screen creates until
the next deploy, and an edit to an already copied row would never arrive.

How it works: a session listener sees every flush.
  * new rows of a retired store are handed, in the same transaction, to
    ``sync_source_rows`` in app/commands/consolidate_work_packages.py -- the one
    per-row copy path the deploy merge also uses; a row edited later passes only
    the columns that changed (read from the session's attribute history), and a
    changed dependency list as the ids added and removed, so what was edited on
    the one store's own screens is never written over;
  * a link added or removed from the other side of the old store's association tables
    (``Gap.work_packages``, ``Plateau.work_packages``) is read from that side's history
    and applied the same way, so the two sides of one association are bridged once;
  * a deleted row of a retired store removes its copy through
    ``work_package_service.delete_work_package`` (dependency clean-up included);
  * a retired row whose copy was deleted carries ``retired_at`` and is never
    copied again.

The bridge is deleted by R1-B04 PR 3 ("retire the old-store writers"), together
with the last writer of the old stores. Bulk ``query.delete()`` and raw SQL
writes do not pass through a flush and are not bridged; the deploy merge and
its --verify step catch those.

"""ADMPhaseGateService — enforces TOGAF ADM phase sequencing via ArchiMate element contracts.

Each TOGAF ADM phase has a gate contract: a list of required ArchiMate element types
that must exist in the workflow_instance_archimate_elements junction table (from a
prior phase run) before the next phase can start.

Phase chain:
    Prelim → A (Vision) → B (Business) → C (IS/Tech) → D (Tech) →
    E (Opportunities) → F (Migration) → G (Implementation) → H (Change Mgmt)

Default required outputs per phase (used when definition.phase_gate_contract is None):
    Phase A requires: nothing (entry point — seeded by Motivation layer)
    Phase B requires: Phase A output containing Driver or Goal elements
    Phase C requires: Phase B output
    Phase D requires: Phase C output
    Phase E requires: Phase D output
    Phase F requires: Phase E output
    Phase G requires: Phase F output
    Phase H requires: Phase G output

        ``ea_workflow_instances`` has no ``architecture_id`` column — the
        architecture context an instance runs against is only ever recorded in
        its JSON ``context`` (see ``EAWorkflowEngine.start_workflow``, which reads
        ``context.get("architecture_id")``), never as a table column. A query
        against ``i.architecture_id`` therefore fails with ``UndefinedColumn`` on
        every call, 500ing every caller. Filter through the JSON field instead;
        when no architecture is given (the phase-summary caller's default),
        count across all instances rather than filtering on nothing.

        Joins ``archimate_elements`` and filters it on organization_id
        explicitly: neither ``ea_workflow_instances`` nor
        ``workflow_instance_archimate_elements`` carries ``organization_id``,
        but ``archimate_elements`` does (it is ``TenantMixin``-scoped), and
        it's the only tenant-scoped table reachable from this junction.
        Without that predicate this raw query — which the ORM tenant listener
        does not touch — would aggregate every organization's ADM phase
        outputs and present them as the current org's. The predicate is
        written as ``:org_id IS NULL OR ae.organization_id = :org_id`` so the
        SQL text itself stays fully static (no string concatenation of a
        conditional clause) — for system/CLI callers with no
        ``g.current_org_id``, ``org_id`` binds to ``None`` and the OR passes
        every row, matching the prior no-clause behaviour.

        No exception handler: a swallowed query error would report ``0``, which
        ``can_enter_phase`` and ``get_phase_summary`` state as fact — "missing
        outputs from phases: [...]" — when nothing is actually known about the
        phase. Both callers run inside handlers that surface the failure, so the
        error is better reported than converted into a gate verdict.

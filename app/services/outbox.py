"""Atomic outbox-emission helper for entity services.

Every entity-service commit that should produce a log event calls
``emit_event`` inside its transaction. The event lands in
``transformation_outbox_events`` and is later relayed into ``event_log`` by
``app/services/event_log_service.py``.

Events written through this helper carry ``entity_type`` and ``entity_id``
so the relay can distinguish them from transformation-command events.

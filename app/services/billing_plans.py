"""
Plan catalogue and plan limits.

The organisation's plan lives on its ``subscriptions`` row (written by
BillingService from checkout and from the payment provider's signed events).
This module is the only place that turns that row into limits, so the billing
page, the add-user screens and the seat counter all give the same answer.

Price ids are never in code: each purchasable plan names the environment
variables that hold its monthly and annual price ids.

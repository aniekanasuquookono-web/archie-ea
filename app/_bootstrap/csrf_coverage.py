"""CSRF default-deny coverage assertion (P-04, supersedes A-04/ARCH-051/C-10).

Flask-WTF's ``CSRFProtect`` already runs a global ``before_request`` that
rejects any POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE without a token, *unless* the view or its
blueprint has been marked exempt with ``csrf.exempt(...)``. That mechanism is
sound, but it is implicit: an exemption is just a decorator or a function
call sitting in whatever file happened to register the blueprint, discoverable
only by grepping the whole tree. P-04 found this pattern had already produced
one falsely-justified blanket exemption (``api_v1``, closed in 9cda379) and a
second one this same audit round (``confidence_review`` API, closed
alongside this module) — a session-cookie-authenticated blueprint labelled
"programmatic callers, no CSRF token expected."

This module makes the opt-out list an explicit, reviewable inventory instead
of an implicit one. It does not replace flask-wtf's enforcement — it audits
it: at boot, once every blueprint is registered, it walks the *complete*
route table, finds every exemption flask-wtf actually holds (view-level and
blueprint-level), and fails loudly if any exemption exists that isn't on the
``CSRF_OPT_OUT`` allow-list below. Default-deny, applied to the exemptions
themselves: a new exemption someone adds later either gets a justification
here or breaks the boot.

``scripts/check_csrf_coverage.py`` runs the same walk as a verify.py gate
(so a bad exemption fails CI, not just a warning in server logs), and
``tests/test_csrf_coverage.py`` (R-30) drives write requests at every
enumerated route to prove the *effective* behaviour matches this list.

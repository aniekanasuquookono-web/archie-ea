"""SSO provider list and IdP group-to-role mapping (COM-005 / ENT-068).

This module no longer runs any part of the sign-in flow. The platform's
OIDC sign-in goes through the account OAuth client (authlib's Flask
``OAuth`` registry, one provider per process, configured from
``SSO_PROVIDERS``); the per-organisation SSO flow (one config row per
organisation, chosen by the signing-in user's email domain) goes through
:class:`app.services.sso_service.SSOService`. What stays here is the
``SSO_ENABLED`` / provider-availability check the sign-in page uses to show
or hide its SSO buttons, and the IdP group to role mapping the callback
handlers use once a user is authenticated: group-to-role mapping translates
IdP group memberships into the platform's ``enterprise_role`` field
(ENT-068).

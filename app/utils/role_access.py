# Persona sidebar zones (shell-overhaul Wave 1)
#
# Single source of truth for the server-filtered sidebar: role -> ordered
# zones -> links. app/templates/components/admin_sidebar.html renders from
# get_sidebar_zones() only (Task 3) instead of the 1,062-line hand-maintained
# template that dimmed out-of-role links client-side. Endpoint strings below
# were resolved by grepping the pre-rewrite admin_sidebar.html for the real
# url_for(...) target of each spec surface; a few spec-named surfaces
# (Portfolio, Investment Analysis) have a real registered blueprint endpoint
# but no existing sidebar link — those are noted in the Task 2 report.
#
# Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-shell-overhaul-design.md section 1.
#
# Fix round (Task 3 review): raised 25 -> 26. platform_admin's two new,
# review-mandated admin-zone links (Salesforce Integration, Power Platform)
# alone already render exactly 25 real links; the All-modules directory link
# (see _LIBRARY_LINKS_WITH_DIRECTORY below) is mandatory on every role's
# sidebar and platform_admin has no headroom left to absorb it without either
# dropping one of those two links or raising the budget by exactly the one
# link being added. Every other role stays well under 25 either way — see
# scripts/check_sidebar_links.py's per-role table.
#
# Fix round (evidence review, Wave 1 screenshot pass): lowered 26 -> 25.
# _MY_WORK_LINKS[ROLE_PLATFORM_ADMIN] carried an "Applications" link pointing
# at unified_applications.application_list — the exact same endpoint already
# in _LIBRARY_LINKS, so platform_admin rendered the label twice. Dropping the
# duplicate takes My work from 3 links to 2, so platform_admin's real link
# count (header + 22 zone links + footer All-modules + footer logout) is now
# 25, one below the old ceiling; the budget is lowered to match rather than
# left slack that would silently hide a future regression the same size.

# S-11 (discoverability wave, 18 Aug 2026): raised 25 -> 26. One governance
# link was added ("Decisions" -> arch_decisions.list_decisions), which is the
# only zone platform_admin — the role with zero headroom — shares. Its
# zone-only total goes 22 -> 23 and its rendered total 25 -> 26. The two
# Implementation & Migration links added in the same pass (Gap Analysis, Work
# Packages) land in the enterprise_architect My-work zone only, which has
# ample headroom, so they do not move this number.
#
# S-11 remainder (18 Aug 2026, QA Update 6/8): raised 26 -> 27. Ten modules
# were reachable only from /modules/, never from a sidebar zone. Nine of them
# landed in EA / business_architect / portfolio_manager My-work zones, all of
# which had headroom; the tenth ("Batch Import") landed in platform_admin's
# admin zone, the only zone that role shares, moving its zone-only total
# 23 -> 24 and rendered total 26 -> 27. The remaining three (my-applications
# list/health/roadmap) were nested as in-page tabs under the existing
# "My Applications" sidebar link rather than given zone entries of their own
# — see app/modules/my_applications/templates/my_applications/*.html.
#
# BA-A1 (21 Aug 2026): raised 27 -> 28. The Business Architecture landing page
# is the front door to all twelve business-architecture outputs, and an
# evaluating architect had concluded three of them did not exist because there
# was no such door. platform_admin is the default enterprise_role for anyone who
# never picked one, so it is the role that most needs the link, and its only
# shared zone (admin) was already exactly on the ceiling. The alternative was to
# retire "Batch Import", but that link exists to satisfy the S-11 finding above
# — trading one discoverability defect for another. Raising the budget by one is
# the honest cost of adding a front door.
#
# In-built error telemetry (10 Sep 2026, commit e7e36195) added platform_admin's
# "Errors" link (see this file's _ADMIN_LINKS) without raising this constant or
# the paired pinned test in tests/test_sidebar_budgets.py — both silently went
# stale and only surfaced as a CI failure during the Phase 0 archie-ea to-be
# plan's CI audit (fix/phase0-ci-and-audit). Measured directly rather than
# reconstructed from history (the exact link-by-link arithmetic in the comments
# above has a small pre-existing drift this fix does not attempt to unwind):
# platform_admin currently renders 30 links. Raising 28 -> 30 to match.
#
# The Ask page's front door ("Ask a question", _ASK_LINK below) is one link in
# every persona's My work, so platform_admin renders one more: 30 -> 31. The
# page is the entry point of the impact question for every persona and has no
# other route in; the Twin map is reached from the Ask page and has no link of
# its own, so this is the only link the two pages add.
#
# Canvas/framework UI fix, round 2 (25 Sep 2026): two new Library links
# ("Canvases", "Frameworks") are shared by every role. The ceiling stays 31 --
# the round-1 attempt raised it to 34 without first checking whether the
# addition actually needed headroom; it did not, once paired with folds. The
# two roles with none left (business_architect, platform_admin) and the one
# with a single link of headroom (enterprise_architect) each lose exactly one
# thing to pay for the two new links; see _MY_WORK_LINKS and _ADMIN_LINKS
# comments below for which link and where it is still reachable. Framework
# Management and Framework Configuration (platform_admin-only) are reachable
# from the admin dashboard page (app/templates/admin/index.html) instead of a
# third and fourth new Admin-zone sidebar entry, which is why they add zero to
# every role's rendered count.
#
# Approval Inbox (4 Oct 2026): raised 31 -> 32. The Approval Inbox is one new
# link in every persona's My work — the single queue for every pending change
# proposal, shared by every persona with GENERAL permission. platform_admin
# (the role with zero headroom) renders it like every other role, moving its
# zone-only total 28 -> 29 and its rendered total 31 -> 32. No fold is
# available: the Admin zone already shed four links in the canvas/framework
# round, and the My-work zone carries only four links (plus Ask). Raising the
# budget by one is the honest cost of adding a genuinely new, intentional link
# that every persona needs.
# R1-B56: Agent Registry (owner, charter, delegated limits per registered
# agent) is a new, genuinely needed platform_admin-only screen, not a
# duplicate of anything already in the Admin zone. No fold is available for
# the same reason as above; taking the budget 32 -> 33.

    correctly 403 them anyway (admin_required checks the Administrator role,

Tool executor: runs tool calls in-process against the SQLAlchemy service layer.

Design decisions:
  - No HTTP.  Direct DB calls only.  One transaction per tool.
  - EntityResolver handles all name→ID fuzzy matching before any write.
  - Ambiguity returns a clarification request; the LLM re-prompts the user.
  - Exceptions roll back and surface as {"success": False, "error": "..."}.

    def _tool_merge_capabilities(self, args: dict) -> dict:
        """Merge one duplicate business capability into another — G3 headline.

        Register gap G3 (docs/CAPABILITY_GAP_REGISTER.md): the copilot could
        DETECT duplicate capabilities (propose_rationalization surfaces the
        clusters) but had no governed way to RESOLVE them. This is that resolver:
        the LLM PROPOSES a merge; because the tool is mutates=True / tier
        'approve', a human approves it through the existing confirmation gate
        before anything runs. There is no auto-merge path.

        REPOINT-THEN-RETIRE, reversible variant.
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        This follows the repoint logic of the abacus consolidation route's
        merge_keep_target (app/modules/capabilities/routes/abacus_consolidation.py)
        — children, APQC process mappings and application-capability mappings are
        moved from the removed capability onto the kept one — but it deviates on
        two points, deliberately, and both are documented here because a reviewer
        must be able to see the safety reasoning without reading three files:

        1. STORE. The task brief cited
           capability_naming_service.merge_duplicate_capabilities. That service
           operates on UnifiedCapability + UnifiedApplicationCapabilityMapping.
           UnifiedCapability holds 0 rows in production (it is the canonical store
           with no producer — see ADR 0008 / the store-agreement gate) and uses
           HybridCapabilityTenantMixin, whose shared-reference semantics
           (organization_id IS NULL == shared) are the wrong isolation model for a
           destructive per-tenant merge. The store the maturity routes, the
           heatmap and the abacus route actually read and write — and the one the
           task's own org-scope requirement names — is BusinessCapability
           (business_capability, 461 rows in production), a plain TenantMixin
           model. So this tool merges BusinessCapability, exactly as
           _tool_record_capability_maturity chose the same store for the same
           reason.

        2. REMOVAL. merge_duplicate_capabilities (and merge_keep_target)
           HARD-delete the duplicate. The owner guardrail requires the reversible
           variant where one exists, and BusinessCapability carries a soft-delete
           (is_deprecated / deprecated_as_of / deprecation_notes). So the duplicate
           is SOFT-deleted — marked is_deprecated with a note naming the kept id —
           not physically removed. The row survives for audit and hand-reversal;
           its references have already been repointed onto the kept capability, so
           nothing is orphaned. The tool's return also carries a full before-state
           snapshot (the removed capability's key fields + every repointed
           reference id) so the action is auditable and reversible even by hand.

        Org scope, self-merge and non-existent ids
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        BusinessCapability is TenantMixin, so the ORM tenant filter scopes both
        lookups: a capability in another org is invisible and reads back as
        not-found — never resolved, never cross-merged. Self-merge (keep ==
        remove) and a non-existent id are rejected before any write.

        The portfolio/application-manager headline write. update_application_status
        is one app per call; this applies one lifecycle stage to many, under a
        single approval.

        DEVIATION from the task brief, made as data architect: the brief cited
        "the ApplicationComponent.lifecycle_status write update_application_status
        does". Those are two DIFFERENT columns. update_application_status
        (_tool_update_application_status) writes DEPLOYMENT_status; the canonical
        bulk lifecycle write is the PLT-020 route
        app/modules/applications/routes/list_views.py::api_bulk_lifecycle, which
        writes LIFECYCLE_status validated against APPLICATION_LIFECYCLE_STAGES
        (NOT app.models.constants.LifecycleStatus — a different vocabulary the UI
        never sends, which rejected every real click). This tool mirrors
        api_bulk_lifecycle: it writes lifecycle_status and validates against
        APPLICATION_LIFECYCLE_STAGES, exactly as the brief's own "validate against
        the real lifecycle enum" requires. ApplicationComponent is a TenantMixin
        model, so both the id/filter SELECT and the write carry the org predicate
        mechanically — apps in another org are invisible and read back as
        not-found, never cross-written.

# One creation path for every ArchiMate element type, installed per type.
#
# The dispatcher in execute() resolves a tool by getattr(self, "_tool_" + name),
# so each element type needs a real attribute. They are installed here rather
# than written out 58 times: the behaviour is identical, and the thing that
# differs per type — what the element MEANS and what it is confused with — lives
# in archimate_specs.py where it can be reviewed as domain content instead of
# being buried in near-duplicate code.
#
# This is still a DEDICATED path per type, not a generic create_archimate_element
# with a type argument. The difference is the one the coverage gate exists to
# enforce: the model chooses `create_business_process` because its description
# told it when a process differs from a function, rather than guessing a string.

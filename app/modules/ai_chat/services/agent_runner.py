AgentRunner: ReAct loop for AI Chat tool use.

Flow per turn:
  1. Build system prompt (agent framing + live domain context)
  2. Call LLM with tool schemas
  3. If response has tool_calls → execute each → feed results back → repeat
  4. If response is text-only → return final response
  5. Cap at MAX_ITERATIONS to prevent runaway chains

Supports Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI providers.
Tools marked 'approve' tier are queued for user confirmation — not executed.

to the architecture repository. You do not give advice for humans to act on — you act.

WHAT YOU CAN DO (27 tools available):
Phase A — Motivation: create_driver, create_goal, create_constraint
Phase B-D — Architecture: create_requirement, link_application_to_solution, link_vendor_product,
             link_capability_to_solution, create_archimate_element, create_archimate_relationship
Phase D — ArchiMate: run_inference_engine, diagnose_chain, explain_element, simulate_impact
Phase E — Options: create_option, mark_option_recommended
Phase G — Governance: submit_for_arb_review (requires confirmation)
Solution state: get_solution_summary, get_completeness_score, update_solution_fields,
                update_solution_phase, search_archimate_elements, find_applications,
                query_capability_gaps
Portfolio: update_application_status (requires confirmation)
Blueprint: generate_blueprint_narrative (requires confirmation)

HOW TO OPERATE:
1. When the user asks to create, link, map, update, or submit — CALL THE TOOL. Do not describe it.
2. If an entity name is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify BEFORE calling a write tool.
3. After each successful tool call, confirm what was done in plain English.
4. For 'approve' tier tools, state exactly what you will do and let the confirmation card handle it.
5. Never fabricate IDs. Always use names — the system resolves them to IDs.
6. If solution_id is in the ACTIVE SOLUTION CONTEXT below, pass it to all tools automatically.

GROUNDING — this is a system of record, so an unverifiable answer is worse than none:
7. State a fact about the portfolio only if a tool returned it or it appears in the
   context below. If neither, say you would need to look it up, and look it up.
8. Refer to records by the exact name the tool returned. The records you read are
   attached to your reply as sources automatically — you do not need to write links,
   but the names must match or the citation will not line up with what you said.
9. Read the coverage fields on every tool result. When a result says it is showing
   N of M, report M as the total and say the list is partial. Never present the
   number of rows you were shown as the number that exists.
10. When context arrives with an "_omitted" key, those parts were withheld for size
    and are NOT empty — retrieve them with a tool before drawing a conclusion.

            regardless of the write-approval gate.
          - mutates is True: the write-approval gate. A tool that writes must
            always queue — the auto_execute switch only controls whether reads
            run unconfirmed, not whether writes do.
          - risk_class in {"write", "external_action"}: a tool that writes
            directly or triggers external side effects must always queue,
            even if auto_execute is on. This is the backup guard for the 17
            tier="auto" mutating tools.

        Read and propose tools (risk_class "read" or "propose", mutates False)
        are never queued by this rule — gating reads would put every search
        behind a confirmation prompt, which is the failure mode
        toggle_auto_execute's docstring warned against.

        Pure and schema-driven so it can be exhaustively unit-tested without a
        DB, an LLM, or a Flask request/session.

        Fails CLOSED on an unclassified tool. TOOL_SCHEMA_BY_NAME.get(name, {})
        in the run loop below hands this {} for any tool name the registry does
        not recognise, and `mutates` is absent from every real schema only in
        that case (every registered tool declares it explicitly — see
        tests/test_tool_mutates_flag.py). Treating "we don't know" the same as
        "doesn't mutate" would let an unregistered or future tool execute
        unqueued the moment it forgot to declare the flag; treating it as

    One email per organisation, listing every overdue item currently pending

    attempted, so a later sweep never re-notifies for the same row (matching
    the "no duplicate work" shape of the digest-email jobs this reuses). Runs
    outside any request/tenant context — same shape as
    app/_bootstrap/_digest_emails.py's scheduled digests — so it resolves
    recipients and organisation membership explicitly per row rather than
    relying on request-scoped tenant filtering.

    Returns a summary: organisations notified and rows escalated.

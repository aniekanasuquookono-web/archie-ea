# rows (renaming a role string would silently orphan any user already saved
# with the old spelling — see CLAUDE.md's schema-drift warning), so every
# other vocabulary derives from / validates against ARCHITECT_PERSONAS
# through PERSONA_ALIASES instead of being renamed to match it byte-for-byte.
# This assertion is the enforcement: a new PERSONA_CONFIGS entry that isn't
# either a real charter key or an aliased spelling fails at import time

HIGH CONCENTRATION RISK VENDORS (8+ dependent applications):

CAPABILITY COVERAGE BY VENDOR (which business capabilities each vendor's products support):

ALTERNATIVE VENDORS BY CAPABILITY (capabilities served by multiple vendors — competitive landscape):

Instructions:
1. Answer using the live vendor data — reference specific vendor names and their application counts.
2. Identify concentration risks (single-vendor dependencies) by name.
3. Recommend diversification strategies where concentration is high.
4. Assess vendor risk using the dependent_applications count as a proxy for lock-in risk.
5. Provide actionable procurement recommendations.
6. When relevant, show which business capabilities each vendor covers and their coverage percentages.
7. Highlight alternative vendors that cover the same capabilities — use the competitive landscape data to recommend options.
8. Be specific — name vendors, counts, coverage percentages, and risk levels from the data above."""

LIVE PORTFOLIO SUMMARY:
{summary_str}
{entity_str}{cross_entity_block}{semantic_block}{health_block}{blast_radius_block}{decision_block}{scenario_block}
Instructions:
1. Answer the question using the live portfolio data above — be specific about counts and names.
2. If the user asks about specific applications, capabilities, or vendors, use the resolved entity data.
3. If cross-domain semantic matches are provided, incorporate the most relevant ones into your answer and cite the entity type.
4. Apply TOGAF and ArchiMate 3.2 frameworks where relevant.
5. If BLAST RADIUS data is provided, structure your response around: (a) affected applications and their criticality, (b) capabilities at risk of losing support, (c) risk score and level, (d) recommended mitigation steps.
5. Suggest which domain to switch to for deeper analysis (e.g. "Switch to Gap Analysis domain for a detailed breakdown").
6. Be concise but precise — this is an enterprise tool, not a chatbot.
7. If you don't have enough data to answer, say so clearly and suggest the right slash command or domain."""

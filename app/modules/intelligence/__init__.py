"""Derived-fact intelligence: computes and serves architecture insights that
are derived from existing ArchiMate data rather than entered directly (e.g.
transitive relationship chains), and keeps those derived facts fresh when
the underlying elements or relationships change.

``register(app)`` is the one place this module attaches its pieces: the ORM
invalidation hook and the API blueprint, then the UI blueprint that serves the
Ask and Twin map pages.

The derivation runner itself mounts nothing: it computes and returns a
``DerivationResult``. Everything a person can open lives in the two blueprints
registered below.

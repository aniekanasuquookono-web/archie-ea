"""DE-14: the closed reason-code vocabulary (FR-15, NFR-2).

One vocabulary, read by both the REST and MCP surfaces (SEC-15; sdd-v2.md
§ API-8). No endpoint may invent an absence string inline — a new absence
condition adds a member here, and nowhere else.

Every code renders as an informative empty state with a one-click fix, never
a blank, a zero or an estimate (UX principle P-3; the ``fabricated-data``
gate enforces this mechanically at the template layer, out of scope here).

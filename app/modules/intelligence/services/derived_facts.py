"""DE-3 read path: the ONE accessor over the derived-fact store (ADR-004).

Every read applies ``stale = FALSE`` by default, in this one place, so
"forgot the filter" is not reachable from a caller. ``include_stale=True``
returns stale rows too, each carrying ``"stale": True`` and
``"reason": "derivation_stale"`` (the DE-14 closed-vocabulary member).

Task 03's endpoints are the only permitted callers beyond this module's own
tests -- no other read path over the store may exist at L1 (NFR-8).

Deliberately does NOT use ``app.jobs.tenant_safe_job.tenant_scope()`` (round-1
refuter finding D4). ``tenant_scope()`` is a background-job harness: it calls
``db.session.remove()`` on entry and exit, which is exactly right for a
scheduled job's own dedicated session lifecycle but destructive inside a live
request -- it discards the REQUEST's session (detaching whatever
``flask_login`` cached on ``g._login_user``, corrupting `after_request`
handlers that touch ``current_user``) and clobbers ``g.current_org`` for the
rest of the request (``tenant_scope``'s ``finally`` only restores
``current_org_id``). A request already has ``g.current_org_id`` set correctly
by the ordinary request lifecycle, and the existing tenant-isolation
``do_orm_execute`` listener (``app/middleware/tenant_isolation.py``) already
filters every ORM read by it -- no extra wrapper is needed or safe here. An
explicit ``organization_id`` equality check is still applied below as
defence-in-depth for the id-lookup path, matching the pattern used elsewhere
in this module for raw-SQL predicates.

    T-004 additive parameters (D4 in ``00-verification-notes.md``):

      positional filters, effectively an AND on that pair) is preserved for
      any caller not passing ``direction``. When ``direction="both"`` is
      passed together with a single ``element_id``-shaped filter (i.e. the
      caller passes the SAME id as both ``source_element_id`` and
      ``target_element_id``, T-004's calling convention -- see
      ``query_service.py``), the predicate becomes ``source = X OR
      target = X`` instead of ANDing the two columns. This is additive: an
      existing caller that never passes ``direction`` sees no behaviour
      change.
    - ``layer`` -- filters to rows whose source OR target element is on the
      named ArchiMate layer, via a join to ``ArchiMateElement`` (also
      ``TenantMixin``-fenced, so no hand-written predicate is needed on that
      side either).

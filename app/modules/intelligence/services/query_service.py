        ``cross_layer_impact`` already runs for L1 -- no second traversal
        algorithm, per the platform convention against parallel scoring
        logic.

        Risks are also reached through a ``RiskEntityLink`` of type
        ``application`` whose ``entity_id`` is the ``ApplicationComponent``
        this element resolves to (the element-to-component resolution
        ``portfolio_component_for_element`` already makes, called here, not
        copied). Each risk carries ``seeded_via`` (``element`` or
        ``application_link``); a risk that is both mirrored on the element
        and linked to its component is listed once, as ``element``. A linked
        risk seeds the same traversal from the same element.

        Solution and programme links carry no ArchiMate mirror id, so they
        cannot be followed to an element. They are not dropped: the answer's
        ``link_resolution`` block counts them by type across the tenant, with
        the reason ``risk_link_unresolvable``. That block says what this
        answer cannot see, not that this element has none.

        Score is a **display** label, not a stored fact (per
        ``intelligence-lenses-v1.md`` L6): each risk's own
        ``likelihood x impact`` is shown on its row; when a risk's blast
        radius reaches other elements, the chain's aggregate score is the
        single worst (max) risk reaching it, the conservative choice
        documented in the L3/L6 brief, not a summed exposure figure.

        duplicated?": resolves an element to the ``ApplicationComponent``
        row the rationalization/duplicate/TCO pages are keyed on, so the
        caller can build the ONE genuine deep link that exists today
        (``unified_applications.rationalization_planning``).

        No query of its own beyond that resolution -- reuses the exact
        dual-lookup already established in
        ``app/modules/solutions_strategic/v2/routes/strategic_routes.py``
        (the element's own ``application_component_id`` FK first, the
        reverse ``ApplicationComponent.archimate_element_id`` lookup for
        legacy rows second) rather than inventing a second answer to the
        same question.

        Duplicate-detection and TCO history were checked against this same
        brief and found to have NO per-application HTML page today (both
        are JSON-only API endpoints, `GET .../enterprise/analysis/<id>` and
        `GET /api/advanced-tco/history` keyed by `vendor_product_id` not an
        element/app id) -- so this method, deliberately, resolves only what
        the one real page needs. Linking to a JSON response would not be a
        deep link a person can read; not built.

        A picked ``Capability`` element also gets ``vendor_concentration``:
        the organisation's vendor mappings for the capability that mirrors
        it, as recorded, with single-vendor stated as the count of rows (see
        ``_vendor_mappings_for_capability_elements``). Any other element type
        gets the ``no_capability_in_chain`` block, and the early branches get
        none. Callers that only need the component id pass
        ``include_vendor_concentration=False``.

        Beside ``application_component_id``, the answer carries a
        ``component`` block: the resolved component's name, its
        owner-recorded health, its entered cost figures, its latest
        fiscal-period cost row and its licence entitlements -- built below
        off the SAME ``component`` object resolved above (no second
        component select), in exactly two more selects of its own. Every
        early branch below returns ``component: None`` -- nothing was
        resolved, and the branch's own reason already says why.

        element_id``, and ``element_id`` is only ever reached here after
        the element itself was confirmed to belong to the caller's tenant
        (below). A cross-tenant work package cannot share a seed element id
        with the wrong org's element, since ``archimate_elements.id`` is a
        real primary key each row of which belongs to exactly one tenant.
        This does not make ``UnifiedWorkPackage`` itself tenant-safe for any
        OTHER read path against it -- flagged as a separate, pre-existing
        gap in the L5 brief, not fixed here.

        Cost variance is read from the model's own ``estimated_cost``/
        ``actual_cost`` fields directly, NOT via
        ``UnifiedWorkPackage.calculate_budget_variance()`` -- that helper
        returns a bare 0 both when there is no cost data and when the
        package is exactly on budget, the same not-computed-vs-measured-
        zero collision CLAUDE.md's no-fabrication rule exists to catch.
        Variance is only reported when ``estimated_cost`` is a real
        positive number; otherwise the row carries the honest
        ``not_costed`` reason.

        Plateau and gap: the work package's plateau and gap are its ArchiMate
        relationships (read through ``work_package_service.plateau_and_gap_links``),
        then resolved against the ``Plateau``/``Gap`` tables (each carrying its
        own ``TenantMixin``) in two selects, tenant-scoped explicitly, in
        addition to the ORM listener -- a foreign-tenant row a work package
        happens to point at (the FK itself is not tenant-checked) simply
        does not come back, and reads exactly like an unset FK: every field
        ``None`` beside ``no_plateau_recorded``/``no_gap_recorded``. A
        ``plateau_transition`` gap lists its own ``originating_plateau_id``/
        ``target_plateau_id`` as the recorded ids -- no name lookup for
        them. ``UnifiedWorkPackage.priority``/``risk_level`` and
        ``Gap.resolution_status`` all carry a column default
        (``"medium"``/``"medium"``/``"identified"``), so a stored value
        cannot be told from an entered one; the value is carried as
        recorded either way, and ``risk_level_default_possible``/
        ``priority_default_possible`` disclose the possibility rather than
        the read reinterpreting it. Every row of each package's own
        ``affected_rows`` also carries the element's own recorded
        classification (``plateau``: ``"Baseline"``/``"Target"``/
        ``"Transition"``/``None``, from ``ArchiMateElement.togaf_plateau``)
        in a third, separate select -- ``_resolve_elements_batch``'s
        four-key identity-map projection is not widened to carry it.
        ``is_baseline`` is read in that same select but not carried into the
        answer: it would duplicate ``plateau == "Baseline"`` with a
        ``False`` default that would misleadingly read as "confirmed not
        baseline" for an element nobody has classified yet.

        version shipped one anyway rather than using the one that already
        existed. Not a "still undecided" state; a "not built safely yet"
        one, and the two must not be conflated in copy or reason naming.

        The original version re-implemented the element -> component ->
        ownership -> unit chain that ``_resolve_owners_batch``/
        ``_sec09_tenant_check`` already provide (``cross_layer_impact``'s
        own owner field), without that function's tenant assertion. It also
        had a real, unreviewed tenant-isolation gap of its own:
        ``OrganizationUnit`` carries no ``TenantMixin``/``organization_id``,
        and the original fetched it by ``organization_unit_id`` with no
        tenant predicate at all, so a cross-tenant-seeded
        ``organization_unit_id`` on an otherwise correctly-scoped
        ``ApplicationOwnership`` row would have leaked another
        organisation's unit name/type/head-of-unit -- not caught by this
        lens's own tests, which only exercised the element-level
        cross-tenant case. It also showed expired ownership (no
        ``end_date`` filter) as current, and serialised PII fields
        (``contact_email``, ``head_of_unit``, ...) nothing in the template
        ever rendered.

        Withdrawing the read entirely -- no query against either table --
        rather than patching those in place, since the underlying gap
        (``OrganizationUnit`` has no tenant scoping of its own) needs a
        real, separate fix before ANY reader of it is safe, not just this
        one. The route, question card and tests stay in place so the lens
        is easy to re-enable once a shared, tenant-safe reader exists;
        only the query itself is disabled.

        NOT carry its own ``organization_id`` predicate -- it is scoped
        through its parent: a stage is reachable only through a tenant-owned
        mapping on a tenant-owned value stream (``value_stream_id.in_(vs_ids)``,
        where every id in ``vs_ids`` already came from the fenced value-stream
        select). The join to it is an OUTER join whose ``ON`` clause checks
        both the stage id AND that the stage belongs to the mapping's own
        value stream -- a mapping pointing at a stage of a different stream
        (this tenant's or another's) must not have that stage's name
        attributed to a stream it is not part of. A mapping whose stage does
        not survive the join (null-owner, another tenant's, or a different
        own stream) is listed and counted with ``dependency.stage: null``,
        never dropped and never reported as "nothing recorded" -- a recorded
        dependency is not an absence. ``UnifiedCapability`` is read TWICE
        with two deliberately different predicates -- identity uses the
        permissive ``or_(... is_(None))``, written out in full below,
        because a tenant's own mapping row may name a shared catalogue
        capability and that mapping is honoured; maturity uses the strict
        accessor (``maturity_for_capability_ids``, ``organization_id``
        required), so a shared catalogue row contributes its mapping and
        never its maturity -- a shared number is not this tenant's
        assessment. Maturity is read only through the accessor; no module on
        this path reads ``current_maturity_level`` off a row directly.

        Counts -- every count in this payload is a count of
        DISTINCT capability ids, never of mapping rows:

        ``PortfolioInitiative`` seeded directly on the picked element
        (``archimate_element_id`` FK), each with the SAME blast-radius
        traversal L1/L5/L6 already run -- no second traversal algorithm.

        Tenant-safety note, verified not assumed: ``PortfolioInitiative``
        carries no ``TenantMixin``/``organization_id`` of its own, the same
        gap ``UnifiedWorkPackage`` has (L5 brief). This method never lists
        initiatives independently of an element -- every row it returns is
        filtered by ``archimate_element_id == element_id``, and
        ``element_id`` is only ever reached here after the element itself
        was confirmed to belong to the caller's tenant (below). A
        cross-tenant initiative cannot share a seed element id with the
        wrong org's element, since ``archimate_elements.id`` is a real
        primary key each row of which belongs to exactly one tenant.

        Budget variance is read from the model's own ``total_budget``/
        ``spent_to_date`` fields directly -- ``PortfolioInitiative`` has no
        wrapping helper method to avoid, but the same not-computed-vs-
        measured-zero discipline still applies: variance is only reported
        when ``total_budget`` is a real positive number, else the row
        carries the honest ``no_budget_recorded`` reason.

        When the picked element is a Capability, each initiative row carries
        the capability's maturity block from the T-MAT-1 helper.

"""T-001 acceptance criteria 14 and 16: non-fatal registration.

Deliberately does NOT call ``create_app()`` a second time in this process:
``tests/test_boot_health.py`` documents that a second boot raises "can no
longer be called on the blueprint" for an unrelated blueprint
(``app/modules/codegen/services/sap_importer.py`` attaches routes after
registration), which would make this file's result depend on run order
rather than on the behaviour under test. Instead this exercises
``app._bootstrap.blueprints._register_intelligence`` directly against a
minimal stub app object — the same try/except path a real boot runs through,
without re-invoking ``create_app()``.

**Updated for T-003.** T-001's original ``test_register_mounts_no_blueprint_and_no_route``
asserted nothing was mounted, because T-001 shipped no query surface by
design (sdd-v2.md OA-5). T-003 is the task that adds one: the
``intelligence_api`` blueprint (recompute + provenance-expansion routes,
task 03), registered via the same non-fatal try/except this file already
exercised. The blueprint object itself constructs fine against a plain
Python stub (it needs no real Flask app until a request is dispatched), so
it mounts even here -- this file now asserts exactly ONE blueprint mounts,
named ``intelligence_api``, matching NFR-8 ("no query surface beyond these
two routes").

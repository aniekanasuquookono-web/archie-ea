"""T-001 acceptance criterion 13: the DE-14 reason-code vocabulary is closed.

Mapping:
    13 -> test_reason_codes_has_exactly_fifty_members,
          test_unknown_reason_code_is_rejected_not_passed_through

T-004 (US-1) added two members -- ``no_tenant_context`` and
``element_not_found`` -- for absence conditions on the cross-layer impact
read path that sdd-v2.md's original sixteen do not cover. T-005 (US-5) added
one more -- ``p95_above_highest_bucket`` (D3) -- for the yield endpoint's
p95 bucket-edge read having no honest number to report when the 95th
percentile falls in the histogram's +Inf overflow bucket. Ask's Portfolio
lens (L3) added ``no_application_component``; the Programme lens (L5) added
two more -- ``no_work_package_recorded`` and ``not_costed``. The Strategy
lens (L2) added ``no_budget_recorded``; the Accountability lens (L4) added
``no_ownership_records``/``capacity_not_available``, later
``ownership_reader_not_built`` when its read was withdrawn per external
review. Role-gating added ``financial_data_restricted``. T-S1 (value streams
at risk, curated path) added four more -- ``no_value_stream_recorded``,
``no_capability_linked``, ``value_stream_not_linked_to_model`` and
``dependency_direction_unknown`` -- of which T-S1 emits only the first two;
the other two are reserved for T-S3's graph path. The maturity read helper
added two more -- ``no_maturity_target_recorded`` (a current level recorded
with no target to compare it against) and ``no_capability_in_chain``
(reserved for a later reader whose chain resolves to no Capability element
at all). The Portfolio-block additions added three more --
``no_cost_recorded``, ``no_health_recorded`` and ``no_licence_recorded`` --
for the component block's cost, health and licence absence conditions. A
fourth, ``licence_usage_not_synced``, covers a licence entry whose usage
figures have never been synced from the source system -- distinct from
``no_licence_recorded``, which means no licence rows exist for the
component at all.
The connection explanation ("Why?" on a derived row) added four more --
``relationship_not_recorded``, ``drawn_by_not_recorded``,
``drawn_at_not_recorded`` and ``rule_not_recorded`` -- reusing the existing
``element_not_found`` for an element on the chain that does not resolve.
The risk answer added ``risk_link_unresolvable`` for a risk linked to a
solution or programme record, which the answer cannot follow to an element.

"Closed" means no endpoint may invent an absence string inline, not that the
set is frozen at sixteen forever; the module's own docstring says a new
absence condition adds a member here, and nowhere else. This test is
updated in lockstep -- this ``_EXPECTED`` list has drifted out of sync with
reality more than once already (found and corrected multiple times,
independently, by different lenses' briefs each adding a member without
re-deriving the true count); merging branches that each added members
independently (L2/L4/role-gating, T-S1, the maturity read helper, the
programme lens's own plateau/gap pair, the Portfolio-block additions, the
connection explanation's four, and the risk answer's addition) is the same
class of drift, resolved here by re-deriving the real count (50) rather
than trusting any one side's own stale number.

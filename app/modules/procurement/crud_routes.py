"""Write paths for the Procurement persona.

Until 2026-07-31 this module exposed seven routes, all GET. A Procurement lead
could read contracts and licences but could not create, amend or retire one -
and neither VendorContract nor LicenseEntitlement was constructed anywhere in
the codebase, so on a new tenant every screen rendered permanently empty. The
persona was named for work the product did not let it do.

Kept separate from routes.py so the read and write surfaces stay legible; both
register on the same blueprint.

Every handler re-reads its row through an organisation predicate before writing.
Both models carry TenantMixin now, so a filter is injected on ordinary SELECTs,
but bulk UPDATE/DELETE are documented as NOT covered by that mechanism and a
client-supplied foreign key is never covered by it at all. The explicit predicate
is what makes each handler safe on its own terms rather than by inheritance.

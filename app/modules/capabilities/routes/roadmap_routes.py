    GET /api/roadmap/gaps returns TWO kinds of gap. Stored Gap rows carry their

    "{capability_type}-{capability_id}", e.g. "business-279". They are not rows;
    nothing with that id exists to point a foreign key at.

    The roadmap's own "Add Work Package" dropdown is populated from that combined

    endpoint doing Gap.query.get(...), which raised and returned 500. The QA

    link in an EA tool -- turning an identified gap into planned work -- cannot
    be completed through the UI", with a modal reading only "Notice / Not Found".

    Converting a derived gap into planned work is exactly the user's intent, and
    the machinery for it already existed: add-from-capability materialises a real
    Gap from a capability via gap_archimate_service. This routes the composite id
    through the same service -- reusing an existing gap for that capability if
    one is already on the roadmap, creating it if not -- so the work package
    lands against a real row and keeps the traceability that justified it.

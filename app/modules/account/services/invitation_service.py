"""
Invitations to join an organisation, by e-mail. ``PendingInvitation`` is the
one record of every invitation not yet taken up (ADR 0008); the Team page reads
it through ``invitations_for`` and nothing else.

Two kinds of invitee, one link (``/account/join/<token>``):

* A person with no account is invited by address: an account is opened for
  them in the INVITER'S organisation, with no password, and the link lets them
  set one. Only then is the organisation role granted and the address counted
  as confirmed. The link is bound to that organisation, so it can put its
  holder nowhere else.
* A person who already has an account gets the same kind of link (when e-mail
  is available); they sign in as that account and accept or decline there.

An account opened by an invitation holds its address only while an invitation
for it is open, and never against the person at the address. Withdrawing the
last invitation removes the account; once they have all expired, another
organisation's invitation may take the address over; and the person may always
register the address themselves, which withdraws the invitations for it.

"""All-modules directory route.

GET /modules — the sidebar diet's long-tail answer. Every link from every
role's SIDEBAR_ZONES (app/utils/role_access.py), deduplicated and grouped by
zone, plus a curated "More tools" section for real, working routes that were
never assigned to any persona's zone at all (surfaced by the shell-overhaul
Wave 1 review). Every link is guarded by the same
`endpoint in flask.current_app.view_functions` check the sidebar uses, so a
non-fatally-failed blueprint degrades one row here instead of a BuildError.

Two rules keep the page honest, both added 30 Aug 2026 after every advertised
destination was requested with a logged-in client:

* a row is only rendered if the current user could actually open it — the page
  unions EVERY role's zones, which previously showed an enterprise_architect 19
  admin/procurement/my-applications links that return a hard 403;
* a row is only rendered if its destination is a real, distinct page —
  `_NOT_RENDERED` drops one permanently-404 deprecated module and four 302
  aliases whose labels promised a module the user had already been offered
  under its real name.

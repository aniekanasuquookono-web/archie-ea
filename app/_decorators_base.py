            # the RAW enterprise_role string to user_roles whenever the
            # account may write at all, and enterprise_role defaults to
            # "platform_admin" for every legacy account ("existing users get
            # full access" -- app/models/user.py). That default is a
            # backward-compatibility label, not platform authority, but the
            # only check above gating it was the same global

"""Tenant-safe scheduled-job harness (ADR 0008).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
Multi-tenancy in Entelim is enforced *implicitly*, by two SQLAlchemy event
listeners in ``app/middleware/tenant_isolation.py`` that key off
``flask.g.current_org_id``:

* ``do_orm_execute``  — adds ``WHERE organization_id = g.current_org_id`` to ORM
  SELECT / UPDATE / DELETE on every ``TenantMixin`` model.
* ``before_flush``    — stamps ``organization_id`` on new ``TenantMixin`` rows.

Both listeners begin with::

    if not hasattr(g, "current_org_id") or g.current_org_id is None:
        return

so **outside a request there is no filter at all**. Every scheduled job runs
outside a request. A job that simply does ``Model.query.all()`` under
``app.app_context()`` reads the whole estate, and — worse — a job that *writes*
under a partially-set context writes into whichever tenant happens to be on
``g`` at that moment. The harness below is the only sanctioned way to run
per-tenant work on a cadence.

The four hazards it closes, in order of how easy they are to reintroduce:

1. **No tenant context** → unfiltered global read/write. Closed by setting
   ``g.current_org_id`` inside a real ``test_request_context``-equivalent app
   context before the callable is invoked, and asserting it is set.
2. **Identity-map carry-over between tenants.** ``Query.get()`` /
   ``Session.get()`` are scoped only on an identity-map *miss*. On a hit they
   return the cached object and emit **no SQL at all**, so ``do_orm_execute``
   never runs and no tenant predicate is applied. A loop over tenants inside one
   session therefore hands tenant B the object it loaded for tenant A. Closed by
   ``db.session.remove()`` between every tenant — see ``_reset_session``.
   *Do not weaken this to ``expire_all()``*: that keeps identities in the map.
3. **Cross-tenant transaction bleed.** An exception in tenant A leaves the
   session in a failed transaction; tenant B then hits ``InFailedSqlTransaction``
   and the whole run reports a cascade of bogus failures. Closed by rolling back
   and removing the session in the ``finally`` of every tenant iteration.
4. **Multi-process duplication.** ``preload_app = True`` with three gunicorn
   workers means anything registered in ``create_app()`` runs three times.
   Closed by ``pg_try_advisory_lock`` — the pattern already used in
   ``app/commands/cutover_capability_tenancy.py`` — held on a dedicated
   connection for the life of the run.

Failures are **never swallowed**. Per-tenant exceptions are caught only so one
tenant cannot abort the others; each is logged at ERROR with the org id and a
full traceback, counted, and re-surfaced in the returned ``JobRun`` — and
``JobRun.failed`` is what the CLI exit code and the operator page read.

Intended home: ``app/jobs/tenant_safe_job.py``.

Job declaration maps
--------------------
Every scheduled job id registered in ``init_scheduler`` or
``init_abacus_scheduler`` must be listed in exactly one of the two sets below.
``_remove_undeclared_jobs`` is called after registration to enforce this: a job
whose id is in neither set is removed with an ERROR log, so an undeclared job
never runs.

The two categories:

* **PLATFORM_JOBS**: no per-organisation association — the work is global
  (error_events, capability projection, the Abacus connection). These jobs are
  guarded by ``job_lock`` alone.
* **TENANT_JOBS**: visited per organisation through ``run_for_each_tenant`` /
  ``tenant_scope``, so each tenant's rows are isolated by the ORM listeners.
  (EA workflow schedules are tenant-scoped because ``EAWorkflowSchedule`` is a
  ``TenantMixin`` model.)

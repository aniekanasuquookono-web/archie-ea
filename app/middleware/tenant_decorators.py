    Capgemini dry-run DEF-036: a demo tenant's org-admin (is_org_admin, not
    is_platform_admin) reached /admin/organizations and every route
    ``platform_admin_required`` guards, listing every tenant on the instance
    (including a real customer's users, emails and Make Admin/Deactivate/
    Delete controls) while the same account correctly got 403 from /admin/,
    /admin/users and other routes gated by Permission.ADMINISTER (a separate
    authz vocabulary — see CLAUDE.md's "Three authz vocabularies" note).
    Requiring both closes the gap regardless of which flag a given account
    was seeded with, and never weakens access for an account provisioned
    with both, which is how a real platform admin is meant to be set up.

    Extracted so every caller that needs this exact predicate — the
    decorator below, and require_org_or_platform_admin further down, which
    app/modules/admin/team_routes.py's platform-admin branch now calls
    through rather than re-typing — shares one implementation rather than

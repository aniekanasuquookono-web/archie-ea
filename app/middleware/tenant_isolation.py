"""
Tenant isolation middleware — automatic query filtering + write protection.

Layer 1: SQLAlchemy do_orm_execute event adds WHERE organization_id = X
          to every ORM SELECT on TenantMixin models.

Layer 3: before_flush event auto-sets organization_id on new TenantMixin
          records when the caller didn't set it explicitly.

Both layers are NO-OPs when g.current_org_id is None (CLI, migrations,
background tasks, unauthenticated requests).

"""
Formula Register — R1-B34 (TB-0135).

Every composite score Archie computes (starting with the rationalization
TIME score) names the reviewed formula and version it was computed with,
instead of carrying its weights as an unversioned, unattributed constant
baked into the scoring service. A ``FormulaRegister`` row is immutable once
created: editing weights creates a new version rather than mutating history,
so a score computed last quarter can still be traced to the exact formula
that produced it.

System of record: this is the ONLY place formula weights live for a
registered formula key. ``ScoringConfiguration`` (application_rationalization.py)
remains the resolver of effective per-tenant overrides for the
rationalization formula specifically; this model generalises the pattern so
other composite scores can register here too, per the brief's own
"generalises the rationalisation scoring configuration" reuse note.

RationalizationScoringService.calculate_app_score treats an active,
COMPLETE FormulaRegister row (every dimension the score needs is present)
as the weights actually used, taking priority over ScoringConfiguration /
policy overrides; it falls back to those, unchanged, when no formula is
registered or a registered one is missing a dimension. A score's
``formula_version`` is set only in the first case, so it never names a
formula that did not produce that number.

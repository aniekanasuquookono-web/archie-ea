"""
ConnectorConfig model — per-organisation connector credentials and settings.

Stores encrypted credentials for external connectors (ServiceNow, Jira, M365).
Unique per (organization_id, connector_type).

``OrgConnectorCredential`` is the sole credential store. All connector routes
and services read from and write to this model via ``OrgCredentialVault``.
Legacy models (``OrgConnectorConfig``, ``DevOpsConnectorConfig``,
``LucidchartConnectorConfig``) are retired: their setters raise so no new
credentials can be written, and a ``migrate-connector-credentials`` CLI command
exists to copy existing rows into the new store.

``ExternalSystem`` (platform-wide, no organisation) is scoped separately and
is not migrated; it remains as-is for platform-level system configurations.

# ConnectorConfig.config and .webhook_config are plain JSON columns that can
# hold real secrets alongside harmless settings (their own column comments:
# "API endpoints, credentials, etc." and "Webhook endpoints and secrets") --
# there is no separate encrypted-credentials column on this model. Returning
# either raw from an API response leaks whatever secret was stored in it,
# even to an admin of the connector's own organisation. public_config() /
# public_webhook_config() below mask any key that looks like it holds a
# secret before either column is ever serialised.
#
# Matched by case-insensitive substring, which is deliberately broad (an
# unrecognised key shaped like a secret is safer masked than leaked). Two
# documented exceptions, both scoped to "auth" specifically (the broadest,
# most collision-prone term here):
#
# 1. "auth" must start a word, not just appear inside one -- checked with
#    _AUTH_WORD_START_RE ((?:^|[^a-z0-9])auth) rather than plain substring
#    containment. Without this, "oauth" (an extremely common, entirely
#    harmless config section name) would match, because "auth" literally
#    occurs inside "oauth" -- which doesn't just over-mask a label, it masks
#    an entire nested dict of otherwise-fine settings. "authorization" and
#    "auth_token" still match (the word starts at position 0 or just after
#    an underscore); "oauth"/"oauth_token" don't trigger via "auth" at all
#    (though "oauth_token" is still masked anyway, via the separate "token"
#    term).
# 2. Even once "auth" starts a word, a key ending in one of
#    _AUTH_METADATA_SUFFIXES (or naming a URL) is metadata ABOUT an auth
#    setting, not a credential itself -- e.g. "auth_header_name" (the
#    header's NAME) or "basic_auth_enabled" (a boolean flag).
#
# Every other term here (password, secret, token, api_key/apikey,
# client_secret, private_key, credential) has no such exception -- e.g.
# "token_type" still gets masked even though it is usually just a label like
# "Bearer", because the cost of over-masking a label is cosmetic while the
# cost of under-masking a real secret is not.
#
# "webhook" gets no exception either, including the _url suffix one: a
# webhook URL (e.g. a Slack/Teams incoming-webhook URL) IS the credential --
# the path itself is the secret, not something a query string strips off --
# so any key naming one is fully masked, never just sanitized.

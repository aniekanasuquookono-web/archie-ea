"""flask backfill-layer-tenancy — give every TenantMixin table a hardened tenant column.

ADR-0002 records the structural bind this command resolves: `reconcile-schema`
can only ever ADD nullable columns, while `TenantMixin.organization_id` is
declared NOT NULL. So when a model gains the mixin, an existing database is left
with a nullable, unindexed column that the model says cannot be null — and, per
ADR-0003, the tenant filter compares with `=`, so any row left at NULL silently
vanishes from every organisation's view rather than failing loudly.

`backfill-value-stream-tenancy` solved this for three tables. The ADR-0003
completion put `TenantMixin` on ~28 more models across the business, data,
technology and physical layers, and hard-coding another table list per adoption
wave does not scale. This command derives its worklist from the mapper registry
instead: every mapped `TenantMixin` model's table is a candidate, and a table is
touched only when something is actually wrong with it —

  * the column is missing entirely (model gained the mixin before any
    reconcile-schema ran here), or
  * rows hold NULL (pre-mixin rows never assigned to a tenant), or
  * the column is still nullable or unindexed (reconcile-schema adds plain
    nullable columns with no index).

Healthy tables are read and skipped, so the command is safe to run on every
boot, which is exactly where docker-compose runs it.

The organisation-column-everywhere brief reused this mechanism rather than
adding a second one: its own text names a new
`app/commands/backfill_organisation_columns.py`, but this command already
provides column-discovery, per-row derivation and
orphan/hardening handling for exactly the same problem shape (TenantMixin
gained on an existing, populated table). Motivation, requirements, strategic
and technology-layer tables newly gaining TenantMixin for that brief are
registered in `_DERIVABLE_ORG`/`_PROVENANCE_ONLY` below instead of behind a
duplicate command; the brief's shared-catalogue tables (framework.py,
framework_configuration.py, reference_models.py, industry_apqc.py) use the new
`HybridTenantMixin` instead, which this command's `_tenant_tables()` does not
discover (nullable is their correct, permanent state, not an expand step).

This is the one place in the codebase allowed to write organization_id on an
existing row; a static check fails the build on a second one. The policy per
table, in order:

  1. Purge. A row whose link to its parent is always set at creation, and
     names a parent that no longer exists, is not unresolved provenance -- it
     is a leftover with nowhere to belong, and is deleted before anything
     else runs for that table.
  2. Derive. Where a row can state its own tenant through a link it already
     carries (a joined capability, a work package's creator, an initiative),
     that link fills organization_id first. A derivation statement can only
     fill a NULL; it can never move a row between tenants.
  3. Assign or defer. What is still NULL after derivation is the true orphan
     count. On a database with exactly one active, non-default organisation,
     those rows go to it. On a database with more than one -- or with none --
     no row is assigned, with or without --org-id: an unresolved row is
     another tenant's data, or nobody's yet, never a guess this command is
     allowed to make. Every such table is reported, not silently skipped.
  4. Index and harden. The index is always added. The NOT NULL constraint is
     added only when nothing was left NULL; a deferred table gets the index
     and is reported, not the constraint, which would only fail. A table
     whose model declares organization_id nullable=True as a permanent
     override of TenantMixin's default (UnifiedWorkPackage, ConnectorConfig
     and the rest of that generation -- an unattributable row is their
     deliberate, permanent quarantine) never gets the constraint either,
     however many rows happen to be resolved; it is reported as nullable by
     design, not as a deferred backlog.

Each table's purge, derivation, assignment, index and hardening run in their
own transaction, committed before the next table starts (rolled back, always,
under --dry-run). A table whose statements raise is rolled back on its own,
recorded, and the run continues with every other table.

Exit codes: 0 whenever every statement issued here succeeded, however many
rows were left NULL -- an unresolved row is reported, not a failure. Non-zero
only for a real failure: a SQL error while repairing a table, a mapped table
the database still lacks the column for after the add, or an --org-id that
does not resolve to the one organisation eligible for it.

# tenant's data to another, the exact failure the refuse-to-guess rule exists
# to prevent (refuter finding H4 on PR 317). Embedded in every such subquery

    --org-id is resolved once, before any table's statements run, so a
    database with more than one active, non-default organisation rejects it
    up front rather than partway through the run. Each table then runs its
    purge, derivation, assignment, index and hardening in its own
    transaction, committed before the next table starts (rolled back, always,
    under dry_run). A table whose statements raise is rolled back on its
    own, recorded in "failed", and every other table still runs.

    Returns {"repaired": [...], "skipped_healthy": n, "absent": [...],
    "unresolved": {table: count}, "failed": {table: reason},
    "nullable_by_design": [...]}. A table in "nullable_by_design" never
    appears in "unresolved": organization_id there is a permanent model
    choice, not a deferred backlog this command failed to resolve.

"""
flask backfill-arb-ea-tenancy — give the 14 ARB/EA-workflow tables a tenant,
derived from their FK parents.

Wave 4 (Phase A, Task 2) added a nullable `organization_id` column to every
ARB and EA-workflow model (see app/models/architecture_review_board.py and
app/models/workflow_models.py). The columns are nullable *on purpose* — the
plan enables TenantMixin filtering (Phase B) only after this command has run
and every row has a correct organization_id. Enabling the filter first would
make every existing NULL-org row invisible to every org (`= org_id` never
matches NULL) — a governance-data outage.

Unlike a single-org value-stream backfill, an ARB/EA row cannot be handed to
"the org that owns this install" — a wrong guess here mis-assigns a
governance record to the wrong tenant, which is a tenant-isolation breach, not
a cosmetic bug. So every row's organization is DERIVED from an already-scoped
FK parent, never guessed:

  arb_review_items          arb_session_id -> architecture_review_boards.org,
                             else solution_id -> solutions.org,
                             else submitter_id -> users.org (NOT NULL, always present)
  arb_review_comments       review_item_id -> arb_review_items.org
  arb_capability_impacts    review_item_id -> arb_review_items.org
  arb_board_members         arb_session_id -> architecture_review_boards.org (NOT NULL)
  arb_exceptions            review_item_id -> arb_review_items.org,
                             else requested_by_id -> users.org
  arb_documents             review_item_id -> arb_review_items.org,
                             else change_request_id -> architecture_change_requests.org
  arb_governance_standards  GLOBAL REFERENCE — see below, never derived/assigned
  arb_audit_logs            user_id -> users.org (plain int, no FK constraint; ORPHAN if unset)
  arb_workflow_stages       GLOBAL REFERENCE — see below, never derived/assigned
  ea_workflow_definitions   GLOBAL REFERENCE — see below, never derived/assigned
  ea_workflow_instances     started_by_id -> users.org (NOT NULL for user-started runs),
                             else workflow_definition_id -> ea_workflow_definitions.org
                             (that fallback never fires in practice now that
                             definitions are global/unorged — see GLOBAL_REFERENCE
                             below — so a scheduled/API-triggered instance with no
                             started_by_id is a genuine, honestly-reported orphan,
                             not a guaranteed hit)
  ea_workflow_step_executions instance_id -> ea_workflow_instances.org
  ea_workflow_schedules     workflow_definition_id -> ea_workflow_definitions.org,
                             else created_by_id -> users.org
                             (same caveat: the definition-org fallback is dead
                             now that definitions are global; created_by_id is
                             the effective path)
  ea_workflow_notifications workflow_instance_id -> ea_workflow_instances.org,
                             else recipient_id -> users.org

GLOBAL_REFERENCE models — arb_governance_standards, arb_workflow_stages,
ea_workflow_definitions — are shared catalog/config data, not per-tenant rows:
globally-unique `code`, seeded from module-level DEFAULT_* constants, never
queried scoped to an org. They correctly have NO organization (Task 3 keeps
them non-TenantMixin; the column stays unused on these three). This command
never derives or writes an org for them, reports their NULL rows in a
separate "global" bucket (not "orphan"), and EXCLUDES that bucket from both
the exit-code orphan count and `--org-id` assignment — stamping a bogus org
onto a shared catalog would be exactly the kind of wrong-tenant assignment
this command exists to prevent.

Processed in dependency order (parents before children, within one
transaction) so a child's derivation can see its parent's just-written org.

Idempotent: every UPDATE is guarded by `organization_id IS NULL`, so a
non-NULL org (already backfilled, or set some other way) is never touched and
re-running is a no-op for rows already resolved.

Runs OUTSIDE request context (no g.current_org_id) — every read is scoped
explicitly by the FK joins below, not by the tenant middleware.

Usage:
    flask --app manage backfill-arb-ea-tenancy --dry-run   # report only
    flask --app manage backfill-arb-ea-tenancy              # derive + write
    flask --app manage backfill-arb-ea-tenancy --org-id 3   # + assign genuine orphans to org 3

Exits non-zero if genuine (per-tenant) ORPHAN rows remain and --org-id was
not given, so a deploy runbook can gate the Phase-B deploy on 0 orphans.
GLOBAL_REFERENCE rows never count toward this and are never touched by
--org-id.

"""
Work package consolidation: backfill-work-package-org, merge-work-package-stores.

`unified_work_packages` (app/models/unified_work_package.py) predates
TenantMixin, so it has no organisation column at all -- every row is currently
unreadable through the tenant filter used by every other model.  Three other
stores answer the same "work package" question with no tenant column either:
`technology_roadmap_initiatives`, `roadmap_work_packages` and
`implementation_work_packages`.  A fourth, `work_packages`, already carries
TenantMixin and is left alone here except for gaining the retirement marker.

This module gives `unified_work_packages` an organisation the same way
`app/commands/backfill_principle_org.py` and the `EnterpriseInitiative`
override in app/models/vendor/vendor_organization.py already do it for their
own tables: reconcile-schema adds the column as plain nullable (ADR 0002),
and a row that cannot be attributed an owning organisation from anything it
links to is left NULL -- the tenant filter's `=` comparison then matches no
organisation, which is quarantine, not a guess.

Attribution rule: the organisation of the work package's linked
programme or element, else its creator, else quarantine.

Run order (deploy-schema.sh runs exactly this, and every step is idempotent):

    flask --app manage reconcile-schema
    flask --app manage backfill-work-package-org
    flask --app manage merge-work-package-stores       # copy rows, remap
                                                       # dependencies, fill
                                                       # fields, tombstone
    flask --app manage backfill-work-package-org       # second pass: a merged
                                                       # row may resolve through
                                                       # a link its source table
                                                       # copied in that its own
                                                       # attribution chain did not
                                                       # try (e.g. an
                                                       # application_component_id
                                                       # carried over from
                                                       # implementation_work_packages).
    flask --app manage merge-work-package-stores --verify   # exits non-zero if
                                                       # any retired store holds a
                                                       # row not yet copied

A copied source row carries `retired_into_id` (its unified copy) and
`retired_at`. Deleting the unified copy nulls `retired_into_id` (ON DELETE SET
NULL) but leaves `retired_at`, so the row stays deleted: the merge and the
bridge only ever select rows where both are NULL.

Until R1-B04 PR 3 retires the remaining writers of the old stores, the same
per-row copy (`sync_source_rows`) is called by the session bridge in
app/services/work_package_bridge.py for every row such a writer creates or
edits, so the one store never lags the old ones. The bridge is deleted by PR 3.

All commands are idempotent: `--dry-run` reports counts and changes nothing;
a second run changes nothing and reports zero.

    """Turn {unified id: {"plateau_id": value or None, "gap_id": ...}} into the
    ArchiMate relationships, one savepoint per work package. With `replace` the
    value replaces the relationship of its kind (None clears it), except for a target
    the old store's association tables still hold for that work package; without
    `replace`, a link is only added. `_moved_links` (relationship ids) gives a copy whose element
    was cleared an element of its own and moves them to it. Two more keys carry the old store's association
    tables: `_associations` adds a relationship for each association row and marks the
    unified row (once, never again); `_association_changes` applies the ids an old
    screen added and removed. A link whose plateau or gap is missing or belongs to
    another organisation is skipped and logged; a failure rolls back that work
    package's links only, is logged, and leaves the transaction usable. The unified
    row is locked (FOR UPDATE) before its links are read, so concurrent edits run one
    after the other. Returns the unified ids whose links were handled (all of them
    but the ones that failed).

    A lock conflict (deadlock detected, serialization failure, lock not available) is not
    contained: it is re-raised after the savepoint has rolled back, so the flush and the
    request fail and roll back whole rather than leave the two stores apart. A call that
    touches several work packages takes every lock first, in ascending id order, before it
    reads or writes any link, so two calls cannot wait on each other in opposite orders."""

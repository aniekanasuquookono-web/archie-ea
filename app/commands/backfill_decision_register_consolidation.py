flask backfill-decision-register-consolidation — decision register consolidation.

Two independent backfills, run together because they share the brief:

1. **architecture_decision_records -> architecture_decisions** (dual-write,
   not a move). ArchitectureDecisionRecord (app/models/adr.py) stays the
   system of record for its own rich review-board fields (capability/process
   links, governance_decision_id, implementation_plan, risk_register,
   cost_analysis, arb_review, decision_matrix and the rest -- none of which
   architecture_decisions has columns for). Every existing pending row gets a
   paired ArchitectureDecision row (source_table='architecture_decision_records',
   source_id=<its id>), and the source row's new retired_into_id points back
   at it, so it now also appears in the one canonical register. Idempotent on
   retired_into_id IS NOT NULL: a row already paired is never paired twice.
   Organisation is preserved from the source row (both are TenantMixin); a
   row somehow missing both fails loudly rather than guessing.

2. **decision_ledger.organization_id**. This table had no organisation column
   at all until this change (see app/models/decision_ledger.py) -- every
   ARB session's decision_ledger service loaded every organisation's rows.
   Derived from the row's capability_id against unified_capabilities.id
   (decision_ledger.capability_id is a string; unified_capabilities.id is an
   integer, so a non-numeric or unmatched capability_id cannot be derived).
   An undeliverable row keeps organization_id NULL -- invisible to every
   organisation via the tenant filter, not a guess -- until a platform
   administrator resolves it with --org-id.

Idempotent: every write is guarded by a NULL/unset check, so re-running is a
no-op for rows already handled. Run one organisation at a time is not needed
for the ADR migration (each row carries its own organisation already); the
decision_ledger derivation processes every NULL row in one pass since the
join itself is organisation-scoped by construction (each row derives only
its own capability's org).

Usage:
    flask --app manage backfill-decision-register-consolidation --dry-run
    flask --app manage backfill-decision-register-consolidation
    flask --app manage backfill-decision-register-consolidation --org-id 3
        # also assigns decision_ledger rows whose capability_id could not be
        # resolved to organisation 3 (manual cleanup only, matches
        # backfill_arb_ea_tenancy.py's --org-id convention)

Not folded into backfill_arb_ea_tenancy.py's framework: that command's core
loop is table-first (`for table, subquery_sql in MODEL_SPECS`), UPDATE-only,
deriving a missing organization_id per table from an already-scoped FK
parent -- fourteen tables, one shared shape. This command's two backfills
are neither: the ADR migration INSERTs a new paired row per source row (not
an UPDATE of an existing organization_id), and derives nothing -- the source
row already carries its own organisation, copied across, never guessed. The
decision_ledger derivation is a single one-off UPDATE...FROM join against
unified_capabilities, not a per-table MODEL_SPECS entry, and doesn't fit
that framework's "backfill organization_id from an FK parent" contract
either. The CLI shape (--dry-run/--org-id, an echo callback, a non-zero
exit when something needs manual attention) intentionally matches
backfill_arb_ea_tenancy.py's conventions -- that similarity is convention
reuse, not the same mechanism duplicated.

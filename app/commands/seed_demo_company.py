"""flask seed-demo-company — create the Lantern Quay Systems demonstration.

Creates the fictional organisation "Lantern Quay Systems" with a coherent
estate of about 300 ArchiMate elements, relationships, applications,
capabilities, costs, risks, programmes, plateaus and gaps, plus a read-only
demo user whose password is read from the DEMO_USER_PASSWORD environment
variable.

Idempotent: running it twice changes nothing. All rows carry the demo
organisation's id. Every name is plainly invented.

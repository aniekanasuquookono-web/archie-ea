"""Ask production whether it is actually working, after the deploy says it is.

Every gate in this repository runs BEFORE merge. `scripts/deploy.sh` then
verifies exactly one thing after shipping: that `/health` returns 200. Nothing
has ever checked that a page works, and nothing has ever run against production
on a schedule -- there is one CI workflow and it has no cron.

That is the gap this closes, and it is not theoretical. On 31 Aug 2026 the owner
opened /capability-maturity/search on the deployed site and got a page that
rendered correctly, returned HTTP 200, and said "This page could not load its
data". The cause was raw SQL naming a column that does not exist. An audit of
21,978 page loads had passed that page, because it checked status codes -- and
a page telling the user it is broken IS a 200.

So this checks the two things a status code cannot see:

1. **Does any page tell the user it is broken?** An error banner served with 200
   is the signature of a swallowed exception. This is the symptom check: it
   catches the whole family (bad SQL, dead API, failed fetch, missing column)
   without knowing the cause.

2. **Is production logging errors nobody reads?** Several failures found today
   were logged at DEBUG and vanished. They are now WARNING -- but nothing was
   listening to WARNING either. Counting them turns the log into a signal.

Anonymous by design. It signs in as nobody, so it only sees public and
login-gated-redirect surfaces. That is a real limit and is reported as one
rather than glossed: the deep authenticated pages are covered by
tests/smoke/test_no_error_banners.py against a seeded database, and this is the
production-side complement, not a replacement.

    python scripts/post_deploy_verify.py                        # the live site
    python scripts/post_deploy_verify.py --base https://host    # somewhere else
    python scripts/post_deploy_verify.py --logs                 # + container log scan
    python scripts/post_deploy_verify.py --json

Exit code is 1 when production is failing, so scripts/deploy.sh can roll back on
it. That is the point: a deploy that serves /health but 500s the dashboard is a
failed deploy, and until now it was a successful one.

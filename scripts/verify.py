"""Archie verification runner — one command, every gate.

    python scripts/verify.py                # run every gate that can run here
    python scripts/verify.py --json         # machine-readable result
    python scripts/verify.py --gate compile # run one gate
    python scripts/verify.py --require-db   # turn DB-dependent SKIPs into failures (CI)
    python scripts/verify.py --update-baseline   # re-measure ratchets (see below)

Why this exists
---------------
``app/templates/macros/ZERO_TOLERANCE_PROTOCOL.md`` asks every agent to verify its
work against a mandatory protocol. A protocol document cannot enforce itself: at
the time this runner was written the repository had 8 test files and a CI lint step
reading ``ruff check . || true`` inside ``continue-on-error: true``. This script is
the executable form of that protocol — the thing you can actually run, and that CI
can actually fail on.

Gate kinds
----------
``zero``     the measurement must be exactly 0. Used only where the tree is
             already clean, so the gate can never be satisfied by regression.
``ratchet``  the measurement must not exceed a recorded baseline. This is how a
             tree with 4482 known lint findings and 1255 known token violations
             gets a meaningful gate today instead of after a multi-month cleanup:
             the number is allowed to fall, never to rise.
``command``  a subprocess that must exit 0.

Ratchets are stored in ``verification_baseline.json``. Lowering a baseline is
routine — run ``--update-baseline`` after a cleanup. *Raising* one is a deliberate
act that shows up in review as a changed number, which is the point.

Skips are loud
--------------
A gate that cannot run reports SKIP with a reason and is listed in the summary. It
never counts as a pass. CI passes ``--require-db`` so that a missing database
fails the build rather than quietly shrinking the gate set.

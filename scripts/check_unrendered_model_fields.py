"""Find a detail-view template that never renders a text/JSON field its own
model declares.

Motivating case: `app/templates/architecture_decisions/detail.html` rendered
`context`, `decision`, `consequences` and `alternatives` from
`ArchitectureDecision`, but not `rationale`, `constraints`, or the GOV-02
approval trail (`decided_by`/`decided_at`/`approved_by`/`approved_at`/
`rejection_reason`) -- all real columns a real workflow writes
(`ADRService`/`adr_routes.py`'s approve/reject routes). The page looked
"empty" for approved and rejected decisions because their most important
content had nowhere to render. Found by hand; this makes it a measurement.

What is flagged
----------------
A Python route function that:

1. fetches a single row via `<Model>.query.get_or_404(...)` or
   `<Model>.query.get(...)`, assigned to a local variable, and
2. calls `render_template("<path>", ...)` in the same function

is a "detail view" of `<Model>` rendering `<path>`. For each such pairing,
this script resolves `<Model>`'s source file (a `class <Model>(...):` in
`app/models/**/*.py`), extracts its `Text` and `JSON` columns (the content
fields most likely to carry the "why"/"what" of a record -- Integer/Boolean/
DateTime columns are excluded: usually ids, flags or timestamps already
covered by other checks, and including them found nothing but noise in
practice), and checks whether each one appears anywhere in the rendered
template's own source text (a name match, not a full Jinja variable-flow
analysis) or in any partial that template `{% include %}`s (one level).

A field is flagged only when NONE of: the template, its includes, or a
`.gitignore`-parallel per-field escape all mention it.

Scope limitation (disclosed, not silent): this is a heuristic name match, not
type-aware Jinja analysis. It does not know which template variable holds the
`<Model>` instance versus something else, so a template that happens to
contain the field name in unrelated prose will read as covered (a false
negative, not a false positive -- this script undercounts, it does not cry
wolf). It does not follow `to_dict()`/JSON-API responses at all -- a field
exposed only through an API a JS component reads is invisible to it, so a
frontend gap of that shape needs a different check, not this one. It also
only looks one function deep for the `render_template` call: a route that
delegates rendering to a helper is not seen. These are the same trade-offs
`check_crosswalk_writer_gated.py` documents for its own one-level traversal
-- cheap and directionally reliable beats exhaustive and unmaintainable.

Escape hatch
------------
`unrendered-field-ok: <reason>` on the field's own `db.Column(...)` line (or
the line above it) suppresses that one field for that one model -- e.g. a
column that is genuinely write-only (an internal audit marker never meant for
display), or one rendered through a mechanism this script cannot see (an API
response, a PDF export). Bare `unrendered-field-ok` with no reason does not
suppress.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/check_unrendered_model_fields.py            # list findings
    python scripts/check_unrendered_model_fields.py --count    # trailing count

Proven-against: tests/test_unrendered_model_fields_gate.py, which caught a
real bug in its own first draft, not just the checker's: the escape-hatch's
"check the line above too" rule let a trailing `unrendered-field-ok:` marker
on one column's line suppress the very next column as well, because that
next column's "line above" was the marked line. The positive/negative/escape
controls (fake Widget model + template on disk) went red on the escape
control specifically, not a contrived failure -- fixed by only counting the
line above when it is not itself another column's own declaration.

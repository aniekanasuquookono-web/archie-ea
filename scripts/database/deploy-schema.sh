# of those commands read scope/organization_id on rows that may already be
# sitting there unclassified, and `apply`'s own ordering guard
# (app/commands/cutover_capability_tenancy.py) otherwise blocks a projection
# run from leaving every freshly-projected row permanently 'ambiguous'.
#

# (CutoverBlocked) -- it is not a mechanism this script invents, it already
# existed in cutover_capability_tenancy.py before this change. Bridges to

# its last line), written either by that script (archie-backup.timer) or, in
# production, by deploy/write-backup-marker.sh called from the production
# backup step after its own verified dump -- same format, same reader, no
# second marker mechanism. scripts/database/backup_marker_to_manifest.sh
# turns that marker into the JSON manifest the cutover command requires.
# A box that has not completed a verified backup yet has no marker, so this

# Corrected 17 Sep 2026 -- this comment previously said project-capabilities
# was deliberately NOT suppressed. That was wrong: run_projection() can raise
# ProjectionBlocked for any one of five reasons (app/commands/project_capabilities.py),
# several of which are a SINGLE tenant's bad data (a tenant_code_collision or
# archimate_id_collision belonging to one org), not a global schema problem. With
# `set -eu` and this line unsuppressed, that one tenant's bad row aborted schema
# deploy for EVERY tenant on the box -- the exact blast-radius mistake the other
# backfill-* lines above already avoid with `|| echo WARN`. Matching that
# convention here: a blocked projection is loud (stderr WARN + whatever
# project-capabilities itself already logs) but non-fatal, so unrelated tenants
# still get a working boot while the blocked tenant's projection is fixed
# separately. `unified_capabilities` staying stale for one tenant is a `store-agreement`/
# `canonical-store` finding to chase down, not a reason to 503 the whole platform.
# Corrected again 17 Sep 2026 (round 3) -- `owner_or_code_changed_since_projection`
# is no longer one of the reasons this command aborts its whole run: it is now a
# per-row skip (report["skipped"]), not a hard blocker, so THIS WARN firing means
# one of the four remaining hard blockers (ownerless_source_rows,
# tenant_code_collision, archimate_id_collision, source_hierarchy_cycle) or a lock
# conflict / missing index, not a moved row.

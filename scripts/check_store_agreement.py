"""Two surfaces answer one question and give different numbers.

Every other gate in this repository reads SOURCE. This one reads ANSWERS.

The owner found all three of these by clicking around the deployed product,
while all 70+ gates were green:

  * /capability-map/ printing "Total Capabilities 191" directly above a table
    reading "Showing 1-10 of 0 results";
  * the Capability Roadmap counting 173 gaps beside a Gap Analysis screen
    reading 0;
  * GET /api/v1/capabilities returning an empty list while `business_capability`
    held 461 rows.

They are one defect wearing three faces: a concept lives in more than one store,
each screen reads a different one, and the product contradicts itself in front
of the user. No source-reading gate can see it, because every individual line is
correct -- `/dashboard/api/capabilities` counting BusinessCapability and
`/api/v1/capabilities/` paginating UnifiedCapability are both perfectly good
code. The defect exists only in the DIFFERENCE between their outputs.
check_canonical_store.py holds the nearest structural approximation (no NEW
table gains a second mapped class); this holds the behavioural fact.

So this gate boots the app, establishes a real tenant, asks every surface that
answers a given question, and fails when they disagree.

Adding a concept
----------------
CONCEPTS at the top of this file is the whole extension surface. A new concept
is a dict entry and two or more Surface(...) lines. A gate nobody can extend
gets bypassed, so keep it that way -- put the model path and the URL in the
registry, never a special case in the engine.

Not reporting differences that are legitimate
---------------------------------------------
Two counts may honestly differ, and a gate that cries wolf gets ignored --
this repository has already had two gates ratcheting phantom findings. Three
legitimate reasons, all handled by the `scope` field rather than by heuristics:

  pagination   a page of items is not the population. A surface returning
               `pagination.total` is scope="all"; one returning the length of
               the items ON the page is scope="page".
  a filter     "active applications" is a different question from "all
               applications". Declare it: scope="status=active".
  permissions  a role-scoped listing answers a narrower question. Declare it.

Surfaces are compared ONLY within their own scope group. Equality inside a group
is required; across groups the only rule asserted is that a declared subset may
not EXCEED the scope="all" population, which is true of every filter, page and
permission narrowing there is. A difference the declared scope explains is
therefore never reported. Anything undeclared is a finding naming both surfaces
and both numbers.

Blindness is reported, not hidden
---------------------------------
Against an empty database every surface answers 0 and agrees perfectly. That is
not evidence of health, so a concept whose surfaces are ALL zero is printed as
`no-evidence` and excluded from the count instead of being silently counted as
a pass. Read those lines: they say the gate could not see anything, and a run
that is all no-evidence has proven nothing.

Tenancy is part of the question
-------------------------------
"How many X does THIS organisation have" is the only question compared. A store
answers it in one of four declared ways, never by counting every tenant's rows:

  TenantMixin     the ORM events scope the query (the request context below).
  organization_id a column but no mixin: the gate filters on it explicitly.
  tenant_via=     no organisation column: the row belongs to the organisation of
                  the first non-null declared link, in order -- the linked
                  element first, the creating user last -- which is the rule the
                  consolidation backfills attribute such rows by. Rows no link
                  attributes are reported, never counted for anyone.
  shared=         deliberately shared reference data (one catalogue for every
                  tenant). Counted whole, with the reason on the Surface.

A store with none of the four cannot answer for one organisation at all. That is
reported as an `unscoped-store` finding once it holds rows, because counting it
whole would let organisation B's rows move organisation A's numbers.

Escape hatch: `store-agreement-ok: <reason>` in a Surface's `waived=` field, for
a surface that is knowingly and permanently a different number (a cached
projection with a documented staleness window, say). Name what makes the
divergence correct and who keeps it bounded.

    python scripts/check_store_agreement.py
    python scripts/check_store_agreement.py --count
    python scripts/check_store_agreement.py --root <tree>   # synthetic

`--root` reads `<root>/store_agreement_probe.json` -- the observations an app
boot would have produced -- and runs the identical comparison engine over them.
That is what makes the JUDGEMENT (which differences are reported and which are
explained away) testable without a seeded database, which is the part of this
gate that can be wrong.

Proven-against: run against the shared test database it reports 1 --
`capabilities: orm:BusinessCapability=12, GET /dashboard/api/capabilities=12,
orm:UnifiedCapability=0, GET /api/v1/capabilities/=0` for organisation 52336 --
which is the owner's third finding reproduced mechanically: the list endpoint
answers 0 while the store holds rows. Confirmed against the database by hand
(`select count(*) from business_capability where organization_id=52336` = 12,
`unified_capabilities` = 0). Red-and-green on a synthetic tree by
tests/test_store_agreement_concepts.py, which also plants a difference that IS
legitimate (a declared narrower scope reading less than the whole) and asserts
it is NOT reported, and seeds two organisations to show that one organisation's
rows never move the other's counts. The same file seeds a real disagreement
in the test database (an application recording a cost the cost store does not
hold), runs observe_tenant and compare(), and asserts red; then records the
cost and asserts green -- and asks the gaps screens as a signed-in user.

# Concepts and surfaces deliberately NOT registered, and why -- naming the
# exclusion is the point, because a hollow entry here would defeat the file:
#
#   maturity gaps     CapabilityGapAnalysis and CapabilityGapDetail
#                     (capability_gap_analysis, capability_gap_details) are
#                     not the planned-gap register above. They are the
#                     maturity-gap concept, owned by
#                     app/services/capability_heatmap_service.py: the distance
#                     between a capability's current and target maturity, with
#                     detail rows hanging off analysis rows (a parent/child
#                     cardinality, so unequal counts are correct). Registering
#                     them under "gaps" would manufacture findings.
#   live gaps         /capability-map/api/roadmap/gaps (the "173 gaps"
#                     tile) computes gaps live from capability coverage
#                     rather than reading a store, and RoadmapGap holds the
#                     rows converted out of that analysis. Whether one of
#                     those is the same "gap" as a row of the gaps register
#                     is a product decision about what a gap is, not a gate:
#                     registering either would manufacture findings.
#   compliance gaps   ComplianceGap is a control a compliance framework
#                     requires and the organisation does not meet -- not an
#                     architecture gap.
#   roadmap           TechnologyRoadmapInitiative is a technology roadmap
#   initiatives       initiative, not a work package.
#   decision ledger   DecisionLedger is an append-only log of governance
#                     events, several per capability; it is not a register of
#                     decisions, so its row count answers another question.
#   blueprint         SolutionBlueprintProposal has no organisation-wide
#   proposals         queue screen (it is read per solution), so there is no
#                     second surface asking its question.
#   RAID risks        RaidItem has no risk kind. Its kinds are issue and
#                     dependency; the R of RAID is the Risk store registered
#                     under "risks" (see RaidItem's own docstring).
#   risk assessments  /strategic/api/risks lists RiskAssessment, a scored
#                     assessment of a capability, not a register entry. It
#                     answers a different question from "which risks does this
#                     organisation hold".
#   HTML listings     /architecture/decisions/ and /procurement/contracts
#                     render HTML, which this gate cannot read. Each one's
#                     query is a registered orm surface (ArchitectureDecision,
#                     VendorContract for the organisation).
#   capability        the coverage percentages (48% vs 0%) are ratios of two
#   coverage          populations each of which is itself contested. Fix the
#                     populations first; the ratio follows.
#   capability        (T-002, corrected round 2) UnifiedCapability.
#   maturity          current_maturity_level / target_maturity_level is the
#                     ONE authority the *maturity accessor* migration
#                     repointed every reader this task touched at. That is
#                     NOT the same claim as "no code anywhere reads
#                     BusinessCapability.current_maturity_level directly" --
#                     it still does, in several files T-002 did not touch
#                     (app/modules/capabilities/routes/mapping_routes.py,
#                     process_routes.py, business_capabilities.py's own
#                     to_dict()) -- an earlier version of this comment claimed
#                     otherwise and was wrong. The "capability maturity
#                     assessed" concept registered above is the real,
#                     engine-backed check for exactly that disagreement: it
#                     compares "how many BusinessCapability rows have a
#                     maturity value recorded" against "how many of the
#                     matching UnifiedCapability rows do too", via a real
#                     filtered `WHERE ... IS NOT NULL` (`Surface.filter_eq` /
#                     `filter_not_null`, added this round), not a bare
#                     population count -- so a stale or never-run projection,
#                     or a raw-SQL maturity writer bypassing it, is a finding
#                     here, not silence. A separate, still-open freshness
#                     signal -- "how many projected rows' source_checksum
#                     currently disagrees with source" -- remains
#                     `app/jobs/capability_projection_job.py`'s own
#                     `stale_row_count` / `last_successful_run_at` on the
#                     structured job-run record, per T-002 task 01; it is a
#                     complementary check, not a substitute for this one.

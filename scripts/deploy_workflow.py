"""Runner-side helpers for the production deploy workflow (standard library only).

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` wraps `scripts/deploy_verified.sh` so a session
that has GitHub access but no SSH access to the droplet can deploy. Everything
here exists so the parts of that workflow that can be checked without a
droplet are ordinary Python with unit tests, not shell embedded in YAML.

    python scripts/deploy_workflow.py preflight [--check-environment production]
                                                [--require-branch main]
    python scripts/deploy_workflow.py setup-ssh --dir DIR --host IP [--user root]
    python scripts/deploy_workflow.py filter-log            (stdin -> stdout)
    python scripts/deploy_workflow.py classify-log LOG --rc N --sha SHA
    python scripts/deploy_workflow.py summary               (markdown on stdout)

preflight    Refuses (exit 1, nothing written) unless the requested ref is a
             full lowercase 40-character SHA, the workflow was dispatched from
             main, the commit is on origin/main's first-parent history (so it
             was itself a commit on main, not only part of a merged branch),
             no branch or tag named like the SHA (or origin/<sha>) exists
             (a name that merely starts with the SHA counts; defence in depth:
             deploy_verified.sh itself resolves a 40-hex ref as an object), and
             every job in ci.yml that is not in EXCLUDED_CHECKS has concluded
             `success` for that exact commit. It also reads the `production`
             environment's protection rules and refuses if the reviewers are
             absent or the rules cannot be read. There is deliberately no
             override.
setup-ssh    Writes the deploy key, the pinned host key, an ssh config with
             StrictHostKeyChecking yes, and an `ssh` wrapper that forces that
             config and repeats the pinning options ahead of its arguments,
             because deploy_verified.sh calls plain `ssh` with fixed options and
             offers no way to pass a key or a known_hosts file.
filter-log   Lets through only lines that begin like deploy_verified.sh's own
             status lines. It matches by prefix and cannot tell who wrote a
             line. This repository is public, so its Actions logs are
             world-readable; anything else the droplet prints (compose output,
             tracebacks) is withheld rather than trusted to contain no secret.
classify-log Reads the raw script output and exit status and says what
             happened: verified, rolled back, rollback failed, or no rollback
             possible. Exit 0 only when the requested commit is verified.
summary      Renders the job summary from validated environment values.

Only the requested commit's identity, enum-valued outcomes and public facts
are ever printed. Secrets are read from the environment by `setup-ssh` alone
and are written to files, never to output.

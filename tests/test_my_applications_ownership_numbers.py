"""My Applications and the portfolio banner agree on what a user owns.

This file asks the screens rather than the code. It seeds one tenant, signs in as
the application manager over HTTP, reads the numbers off the rendered pages
(Total Apps, the health tiles, the panel rows, "All (n)", "Primary (m)" and the
other tabs, the portfolio banner) and asserts they are consistent with each other
and with the ownership rows in the database. It also covers the list page's
paging and search, the health page's tiles, and tenant isolation of the
portfolio's owner count.

Uses the shared fixtures in tests/conftest.py (db_session rolls everything back).

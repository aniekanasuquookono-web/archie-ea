"""S-11 (discoverability wave, 18 Aug 2026) — a module is not "done" until it
can be found.

The register's finding: /modules/ (now the All-modules directory) listed 55
real, working module roots while the sidebar exposed roughly 30 — 25
substantial modules returned HTTP 200 with real content and were reachable
from nowhere a user or evaluator would look. A prior pass (commit 055cec4)
fixed part of this and explicitly logged that it had NOT audited the full
/modules/ estate against navigation; this file is that audit, made
self-enforcing.

The list of module roots below is derived DYNAMICALLY from
`app.url_map` every run — not hand-maintained — precisely so a future
module that ships without a sidebar link or a modules_directory entry fails
this test automatically instead of silently repeating S-11 a fourth time.
"Module root" here means: a GET route with no required URL arguments, not
under /api/, with exactly one path segment (e.g. /procurement/, not
/procurement/contracts/<id>/edit) — the same shape as every route named in
the QA register's list of 25.

Pure introspection against `app.url_map` and `app.utils.role_access` /
`app.modules.modules_directory.routes` — no requests, no fixtures that
register routes at test time (the `app` fixture is session-scoped; this
respects that by only ever reading its already-built url_map).

"""``flask backfill-layer-tenancy`` deriving roadmap_tasks.organization_id.

roadmap_tasks predates TenantMixin and carries no single foreign key to its
owning tenant. The canonical backfill command derives the organisation from
whichever provenance a row actually has -- the work package's creator, the
consolidation entry's application, or the creating user, in that order -- and
a row with none of those is left NULL and reported rather than handed to
whichever organisation happens to be picked for every other orphaned table.
The creating user is checked last because that user's own organisation can
change after the task was created; the other two links do not move the same
way.

There is no existing test of ``repair_layer_tenancy``/``_DERIVABLE_ORG`` on
this branch's base to extend, so this is a new module.

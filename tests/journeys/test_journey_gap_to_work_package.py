"""Journey: can an identified gap become planned work?

The QA audit of 30 Aug 2026 (v2, High 1) called this "the single most important
link in an EA tool" and found it returning HTTP 500:

    "The dropdown is populated with derived gaps whose ids are synthetic
     composite strings (e.g. "business-279" = {capability_type}-{capability_id}),
     not database primary keys... The page supplies a value its own write
     endpoint cannot accept... Work packages can only be created by first
     discarding the gap linkage, destroying the traceability that justifies the
     work."

GET /api/roadmap/gaps returns two kinds of gap. Stored Gap rows carry an integer
primary key. Derived gaps -- one per capability with no application mapped, 543
of them on the audited environment -- are synthesised on read and carry a
composite id. The roadmap's own dropdown mixes both, so choosing a derived gap
sent "business-279" to an endpoint doing Gap.query.get(...).

This asserts the whole chain end to end, because that is the only level at which
the defect is visible: every table involved was healthy throughout.

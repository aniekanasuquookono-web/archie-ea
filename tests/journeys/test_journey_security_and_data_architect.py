"""Journeys for the two personas promoted from charter-only on 31 Aug 2026.

`security_architect` and `data_architect` existed as AI charters that no user
could ever be. They were promoted because their absence created an
inconsistency, not because more roles seemed better:

* the solution blueprint scores a **Security Viewpoint** as one of its fifteen
  sections, and no persona owned it -- the same shape as an ARB decision with
  no visible decider, which this codebase spent the week fixing;
* **data architecture, lineage and stewardship** all ship, and ARCH-123 folded
  them into enterprise_architect with the explicit note "no dedicated role for
  either yet".

The other five charters (application_architect, integration_architect,
systems_architect, business_analyst, product_analyst) stay charter-only: they
own no surface the product grades, and two are analyst rather than architect
roles. That reasoning lives in ASPIRATIONAL in
scripts/check_persona_vocabularies.py so the gap stays visible.

A promoted persona has to be able to do its job, which is what these assert:
sign in, reach the surfaces the role exists for, and perform its write.

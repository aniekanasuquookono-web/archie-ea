"""The admin console must not link to a destination it will refuse.

The sweep found ``/admin/`` rendering 11 links for a user whose
``enterprise_role`` is ``platform_admin``, two of which answered **403**:
``/admin/api-settings`` and ``/admin/feature-flags``.

The cause is that ``enterprise_role`` is a *persona* string driving sidebar and
dashboard composition, while ``@org_admin_required`` and
``@platform_admin_required`` read the ``is_org_admin`` / ``is_platform_admin``
Boolean **columns**. Nothing sets one from the other.

Which half was wrong: the guards are right. ``/admin/api-settings`` edits LLM
provider credentials and ``/admin/feature-flags`` changes platform-wide
behaviour, so both are legitimately narrower than "can see the admin console".
Relaxing them to plain ``@admin_required`` would widen credential access to
every admin — a security regression to fix a navigation bug. The link is
therefore rendered on the same predicate the route enforces.

These tests pin both halves: the tile is absent for a user the guard will
refuse, and present for one it will admit — so a future edit cannot fix one
direction by breaking the other.

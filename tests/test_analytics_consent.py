"""Tests for GA4, Clarity, and search verification on public pages behind consent.

Covers:
- With settings empty: no gtag/clarity markup, CSP unchanged
- With settings set: home page has verification meta tags
- Public page has consent banner, no tag script before consent
- Loader appears with nonce after consent cookie is set
- Signed-in pages never contain gtag/clarity even with consent
- GA4 script only created inside consent handler (defect 1)
- Accept grants only analytics_storage, not advertising (defect 2)
- Banner handlers attached when choice exists; withdrawal works (defect 3)
- Shared artefact page suppresses GA4/Clarity (defect 4)
- _head.html no longer references GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID (defect 5)

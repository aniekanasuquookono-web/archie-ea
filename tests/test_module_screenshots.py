"""Tests for captured screenshots and recordings on public module and
use-case pages.

Covers the "Screenshots on the public module pages" brief, widened
2026-10-06 to include use-case pages and short recordings for four
multi-step use cases, then revised 2026-10-06 after lead review of PR #402
rejected 11 of the 26 captured images and all 4 recordings (empty data, the
wrong screen, or a recording that never performed the use case it claimed):

  - Every live module page (content/pages/modules/*.md, capture_status: live)
    either has a captured image file under the 200 KB cap and renders it
    with descriptive alt text, explicit width/height and lazy loading, OR
    is named explicitly in MODULE_CAPTURE_PENDING with a reason -- there is
    no third option. A live module silently missing from both fails this
    suite, which is what keeps the pending list from becoming a place
    things quietly go to be forgotten.
  - get_page_screenshot() never returns an image for a page whose
    capture_status is not "live", and never returns one for a slug with no
    captured file on disk, even if the registry lists it (checked directly
    against the helper function, not only incidentally through content).
  - capture_status on every pending page stays "live" -- capture-pending
    and feature-pending are different things, and flipping the former to
    say the latter is exactly the mistake a prior round of this same brief
    made and had to revert.
  - The one live use-case page follows the identical pending-or-captured
    rule as modules.
  - The four recorded use-case pages, once captured, render a <video> with
    controls, muted, playsinline, preload="none" and a poster, never an
    autoplay attribute, and their VideoObject JSON-LD carries name/
    description/thumbnailUrl/uploadDate/duration/contentUrl. All four are
    capture-pending as of this revision (see USE_CASE_VIDEO_PENDING); the
    tests that assert those properties on a captured file skip cleanly,
    with a reason, rather than pass vacuously on an empty list.
  - Every captured recording, once restored, is under the 3 MB cap, 15-40
    seconds (read from the sidecar manifest scripts/capture_screenshots.py
    --modules writes -- no ffmpeg/ffprobe dependency at test time), and has
    a poster under the 200 KB image cap.

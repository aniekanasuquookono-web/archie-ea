"""url_map-wide sweep: every route gated by ``admin_required`` or
``org_admin_required`` must refuse an administrator who is only a Viewer in
the organisation currently active in the session.

Background (R1 admin-rbac systemic fix). Three authorization mechanisms
exist in this codebase for "is this user an administrator":

  1. ``admin_required`` (app/_decorators_base.py) used to check only
     ``current_user.can(Permission.ADMINISTER)`` -- a GLOBAL flag on the
     user's own Role, independent of which organisation is active in the
     session (``g.current_org_id``, set by
     ``app/middleware/tenant_context.py`` from the session's switched-to
     organisation, or the user's home organisation if never switched).
  2. ``org_admin_required`` (app/middleware/tenant_decorators.py) looked
     LIKE the correct per-organisation check, but delegated to
     ``current_user.is_org_admin``, a property that is always computed from
     the user's own HOME ``organization_id`` -- never from
     ``g.current_org_id``. Same hole, different wrapper.
  3. ``rbac_service.is_org_admin(user, org_id)`` (app/services/rbac_service.py)
     is the one mechanism that takes an explicit ``org_id`` and answers the
     right question.

Since every self-registered user is granted Administrator of their own
organisation (``AccountService.register_user`` / ``User.grant_org_admin``),
Permission.ADMINISTER alone was the only foothold an attacker needed: accept
any invitation into a victim organisation (even as a read-only Viewer),
switch the session's active organisation to it via the real
``/account/switch-organization`` flow, and every route gated by (1) or (2)
above acted with full administrator authority over the victim organisation,
because ``TenantMixin`` silently scopes the underlying query to
``g.current_org_id`` while neither decorator checked it.

Both decorators now resolve through ``rbac_service.is_org_admin(current_user,
g.current_org_id)`` (OR ``is_platform_admin`` for an actual platform admin),
and each marks the final, possibly-further-wrapped view function with a
``_active_org_rbac_gate`` attribute for this test to find (see the matching
comments in app/_decorators_base.py and app/middleware/tenant_decorators.py
for why ``functools.wraps`` makes this survive further decorator stacking
regardless of order or depth).

This test's job is NOT to prove today's known-bad set is fixed -- it is to
make it impossible for a FUTURE new route carrying either decorator to
reintroduce this hole silently. It walks the real, live ``url_map`` rather
than a hand-maintained list of routes, so a tenth vulnerable route added
next month fails here with no one needing to remember to add it anywhere.

Scope note: this sweep only reaches views wrapped by the two decorators
fixed in this branch. One other, unrelated implementation of
"admin_required" exists elsewhere in this codebase --
``app.core.auth.decorators.admin_required``, used by ``main.settings`` /
``main.get_system_settings`` / ``main.save_system_settings``, all three now
additionally gated by ``platform_admin_required`` directly, so they are not
a live gap even though they don't carry this test's marker. (A second such
implementation, ``app.utils.decorators.admin_required``, had exactly one
caller -- ``adm_kanban_view.init_phases`` -- which has been moved onto the
canonical ``app.decorators.admin_required`` fixed in this branch, so it now
carries the marker and is swept below like any other route. R2-4 (PR 428
round 3) deleted the now-uncalled ``app.utils.decorators`` module outright
rather than leave a second "admin anywhere" implementation importable.)

# refuses this sweep's attacker (who holds neither the platform flag nor
# active-org admin authority) -- so they need no special case. Routes that
# only ever act on the CALLER's own home organisation (new_user,
# invite_user -- keyed off current_user.organization_id, not

# is active-org-scoped, which is a conservative (safe) side effect: see the

    D-3: a placeholder id is enough to reach the DECORATOR (which runs
    before the view body resolves anything against the database), but it is
    NOT enough to prove the decorator's check actually ran, because a view
    whose body does ``Model.query.get_or_404(id)`` (or an equivalent
    org-scoped lookup) returns 404 for a placeholder id regardless of
    whether authorization ever happened -- 21 route x method pairs passed
    this sweep with the PR's own fix temporarily removed, for exactly this
    reason (see the build report). Passing a real id that exists in the
    victim organisation removes that ambiguity: once the row is real,
    "404" can only mean the view's own org-scoped lookup correctly found
    nothing (expected -- the attacker's active org differs from the row's
    real resolution once the decorator refuses them, or the decorator
    itself aborted first), while "not (403 or 404)" with a REAL row present
    can only mean the decorator-level check was bypassed and the view body
    ran to completion against a row that does exist.

    # "element_id") are therefore also moot to seed in isolation -- the rule
    # stays in the pre-existing, more permissive (403 or 404) bucket, same
    # as before this round. "key" (admin.seed) is not a database row at all
    # (a literal seed-catalogue key); left to the existing placeholder.

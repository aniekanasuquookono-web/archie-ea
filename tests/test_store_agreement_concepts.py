"""The store-agreement gate asks every store and screen the same question.

Three things are pinned here:

* the registry names every store and screen that answers each concept, so a
  consolidation can prove it worked (a missing surface is a disagreement the
  gate can never see);
* the comparison judgement, driven through the gate's own ``--root`` probe
  mode: agreeing surfaces pass, a disagreement fails naming both surfaces and
  both numbers, a declared narrower scope is not reported, all-zero is
  ``no-evidence``, and a store that cannot be scoped to one organisation is a
  finding once it holds rows;
* tenancy: organisation B's rows never change organisation A's counts, whether
  the store has TenantMixin, a bare ``organization_id`` column, or only a link
  to a tenant-owned row.

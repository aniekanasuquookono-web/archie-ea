"""Prove tenant isolation empirically, and pin the models that opt out.

Multi-tenant leakage is the defect that ends an enterprise deal, and this
codebase enforces isolation through a SQLAlchemy event listener rather than
through query code - so nothing in a route tells you whether it is working. It
either applies or it silently does not.

This file asserts three things:

  1. TenantMixin actually filters. Two organisations, rows in each, and a query
     from inside one request context must never return the other's row. That is
     a positive control on the mechanism, not on any particular route.
  2. The set of models carrying organization_id WITHOUT the mixin is a fixed,
     justified list. Adding a new one is a decision someone has to make
     explicitly, not something that happens by omission.
  3. Bulk UPDATE and DELETE are documented as bypassing the filter entirely, and
     that remains true - so the documentation stays honest and anyone writing a
     bulk write knows they must scope it themselves.
  4. Every identifier-bearing route in the booted url_map refuses another
     organisation's identifiers - the route sweep at the end of this file,
     with its coverage figure ratcheted in verification_baseline.json.

The gap this closes was real: ApplicationDocument carries organization_id but no
mixin, and the delete handler forgot to scope, so any authenticated user could
destroy any tenant's document by walking integer ids.

# The tests above prove the MECHANISM. This section proves the ROUTES: it walks
# every rule in the booted url_map that carries a record identifier, seeds that
# record in organisation A, and asks for it as organisation B -- then asks again
# as A, because B's refusal only means something when the owner is served. The
# engine is tests/_isolation_sweep.py; the policy it runs under is all here.
#
# Coverage is the share of in-scope routes (one rule, one method) PROVEN to
# refuse: the owner is served, and B gets 403/404/410, is redirected away, is
# served without A's record, or -- for a write -- changes nothing where the
# owner's identical write does. It is printed on every run and ratcheted as
# ``tenant_isolation_route_coverage_pct`` in verification_baseline.json, the one
# ratchet in that file where higher is better, so it cannot fall.
#
# A route that is not proven is one of: a LEAK (fails this test unless it is in
# KNOWN_LEAKS below), "unfenced" (its record type carries no organisation at
# all -- the list a security architect asks for), or a route the sweep could not
# yet drive to a verdict ("unproven", "unresolved", "unseedable", "not_refused",

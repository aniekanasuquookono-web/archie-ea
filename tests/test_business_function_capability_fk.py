"""BusinessFunction.capability_id's FK, repointed from business_capability.id
onto unified_capabilities.id.

ensure_function() in
app/modules/applications/services/application_capability_catalog.py builds
every BusinessFunction it creates from a UnifiedCapability instance (via
walk() -> get_or_create_capability()), never a BusinessCapability, and is
the only code path that ever writes this column. unified_capabilities is
this codebase's single source of truth for capability modeling; the old FK
let that write succeed only when a UnifiedCapability.id happened to collide
with a business_capability.id (the two tables have independent id
sequences) and raised a ForeignKeyViolation the rest of the time.

Five things are proved here:
  1. the declared FK metadata really targets unified_capabilities now;
  2. a UnifiedCapability.id -- the only shape ensure_function() ever writes
     -- is accepted;
  3. a capability_id that only exists in the legacy business_capability
     table is now correctly rejected, proving the constraint target really
     changed rather than the column merely accepting any integer;
  4. the migration does NOT rewrite a pre-existing row's capability_id --
     it is already a unified_capabilities id (the only shape
     ensure_function() ever wrote) and must come out of the migration
     byte-for-byte identical, not remapped through the legacy provenance
     lookup (an earlier version of this migration did exactly that, and it
     was a data-corruption bug: see the migration's own docstring);
  5. a row whose capability_id is NOT a valid unified_capabilities id (a
     genuinely orphaned/legacy-only value) makes the migration fail loudly,
     naming the row, rather than silently leaving it or guessing;
  6. running the migration twice is a clean no-op.

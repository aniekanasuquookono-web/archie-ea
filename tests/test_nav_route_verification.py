"""Every sidebar link is loaded by a test, and renders its own page.

`scripts/route_verification_audit.py` measures the one combination that
actually hurts a user: a route reachable from a persona's sidebar that no test
has ever served. Line coverage cannot see it — such a route can be fully
covered by unit tests of its service layer and still 500 the moment somebody
clicks the link, and clicking it is the only thing a user will ever do.

This file closes that set (`nav_verified` 15 -> 0). For each endpoint it
asserts two things, because either alone is worthless:

* the response is not an error (``status < 400``), and
* the page rendered **its own** content — a marker string that only that
  screen's template produces, or, for the endpoints that are deliberate
  redirects, the specific target they must land on.

A bare ``assert status == 200`` passes for a page that silently rendered an
error partial, an empty shell, or somebody else's template — which is exactly
the state an unclicked link degrades into.

Uses the shared fixtures in tests/conftest.py (``app``, ``db_session``) — see
CLAUDE.md. The hand-rolled module-scoped ``app`` fixtures older test modules
carry are flaky by construction and must not be copied.

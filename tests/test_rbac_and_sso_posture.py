"""ARCH-091 — enterprise identity, tenancy and RBAC, the still-unverified slice.

Commit 2e3bb7f (see tests/test_admin_org_member_idor.py) already audited all
13 admin routes with an <int:...> org/user/member id parameter for
cross-tenant IDOR — 0 vulnerable. This file covers what that audit did not:

  1. The RBAC matrix — the three-tier gate the app actually implements
     (plain authenticated user -> org_admin -> platform_admin, via
     app/middleware/tenant_decorators.py's org_admin_required /
     platform_admin_required, layered with Permission.ADMINISTER in
     app/utils/decorators.py's admin_required) is exercised across all
     three tiers against a representative gated route, not just asserted
     to exist by reading the decorator source.
  2. SSO posture — app/auth/sso.py is a real, non-trivial OIDC
     implementation (Azure AD, Okta), gated by SSO_ENABLED / the
     sso_authentication FeatureFlag. Its dormant-by-default behaviour is
     pinned here: with the flag off, SSO fails closed rather than silently
     accepting requests. The application registers no SAML sign-in route and
     the service has no SAML assertion method; both are asserted from the URL
     map and the class, not from a response code.
  3. SCIM posture — grepped for across the entire app/ tree (case-insensitive,
     "scim" appears nowhere except as a substring of unrelated vendor JS
     filenames). There is no SCIM provisioning endpoint, no SCIM schema
     model, and no SCIM route registered anywhere in this codebase.

     FINDING, stated plainly per the assignment: SCIM is NOT IMPLEMENTED.
     There is nothing to test because there is no code path to exercise —
     asserting "SCIM works" here would be exactly the "note that pretends to
     be coverage" CLAUDE.md's docs/known-issues/ section warns against. The
     honest artifact is this test, which pins "SCIM is absent" as a fact a
     future PR must update if it ever adds SCIM, rather than a paragraph
     that silently drifts from reality.

"""The orphan policy `flask backfill-layer-tenancy` enforces for every table.

Derive first from whatever provenance a row already carries. Purge a row
whose always-set link names a parent that is gone. What is left NULL is
assigned to the one active, non-default organisation when there is exactly
one; on any other database it stays NULL and is reported, never guessed,
with or without --org-id. Each table commits, or rolls back, on its own, so
one table's failure cannot undo another's work.

Fixtures db_session, make_org, app come from tests/conftest.py. There is no
shared "relax a NOT NULL constraint" fixture on this branch's base yet
(T-S4 adds one, on a branch not merged here), so a module-scoped fixture
below relaxes strategic_roadmap_items once for every test in this module,
the one other table it needs that for, the same way
tests/test_backfill_layer_tenancy_roadmap_tasks.py does inline for
roadmap_tasks. None of these tests need a user: the new derivation this
module exercises reads an initiative's organisation, not a creating user's.

"""Tests for the fixed top-level marketing/legal pages (about, security, privacy,
terms, contact, features, pricing, docs) and the /signup and /register redirects.

Covers:
  Every listed path answers 200 (or 301 to its canonical page) on a fresh
  database, requested anonymously.
  /signup and /register redirect (301) to the real sign-up page rather than
  duplicating the form.
  Every new page is linked from the public navbar and the shared public
  footer, so nothing is a dead link.

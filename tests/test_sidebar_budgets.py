    sidebar rewrite): platform_admin's two review-mandated admin-zone links
    (Salesforce Integration, Power Platform) alone render exactly 25 visible
    links, leaving no headroom for the also-mandatory All-modules directory
    link.

    Lowered back 26 -> 25 in the evidence-review fix round: My-work's
    "Applications" link for platform_admin duplicated Library's — same
    endpoint, same label, twice in the sidebar — and removing it dropped the
    real count by exactly one. See app/utils/role_access.py's
    SIDEBAR_LINK_BUDGET comment and
    tests/test_sidebar_render.py::test_platform_admin_hits_the_link_budget_exactly.

    Raised 27 -> 28 (BA-A1, 21 Aug 2026): the Business Architecture landing page
    is the front door to all twelve BA outputs, and platform_admin is the default
    role for anyone who never picked one — so it is the role that most needs the
    link, and its only shared zone was already exactly on the ceiling. Retiring
    "Batch Import" to make room would have regressed the S-11 finding that put it
    there, trading one discoverability defect for another.

    S-11 (18 Aug 2026): raised 25 -> 26 for the one governance link added to
    surface Architecture Decisions, which platform_admin also renders.

    Phase 0 CI audit (fix/phase0-ci-and-audit): raised 28 -> 30 — see
    role_access.py's SIDEBAR_LINK_BUDGET comment and this file's
    test_platform_admin_zone_link_total_is_pinned for why.

    Raised 30 -> 31: "Ask a question" is one new link in every persona's My
    work, and platform_admin renders it like everyone else. The rendered-link
    test asserts the count EQUALS this number, so the ceiling moves with the
    link rather than leaving slack that does not exist.

    Canvas/framework UI fix, round 2 (25 Sep 2026): two new Library links
    ("Canvases", "Frameworks") were added for every role and the ceiling did
    not move — see role_access.py's SIDEBAR_LINK_BUDGET comment for the folds
    that paid for them.

    Approval Inbox (4 Oct 2026): raised 31 -> 32. The Approval Inbox is one
    new link in every persona's My work — the single queue for every pending
    change proposal. platform_admin (the role with zero headroom) renders it
    like every other role; no fold is available. Raising the budget by one is
    the honest cost of a genuinely new, intentional link.

    Agent Registry (R1-B56, 6 Oct 2026): raised 32 -> 33. One new
    platform_admin-only link (owner, charter and delegated limits per
    registered agent); no fold is available for the same reason as above.

    that fallback plus the header logo and footer logout links). An
    equality assertion here, not <=, so a future zone edit that silently
    changes this number is caught rather than absorbed by budget headroom
    that does not actually exist.

    Evidence-review fix round: 23 -> 22. _MY_WORK_LINKS[ROLE_PLATFORM_ADMIN]'s
    "Applications" link duplicated the one already in Library (same
    endpoint, unified_applications.application_list); removing it drops the
    zone-only total by one, and the rendered total (see
    test_platform_admin_hits_the_link_budget_exactly) by the same one, to
    25.

    S-11 (18 Aug 2026): 22 -> 23. The governance zone gained "Decisions"
    (arch_decisions.list_decisions), which platform_admin shares; the two
    Implementation & Migration links added in the same pass are
    enterprise_architect-only and do not appear here.

    S-11 remainder (18 Aug 2026): 23 -> 24. "Batch Import" added to the admin
    zone — the only S-11-remainder module platform_admin shares; the other
    nine landed in EA / business_architect / portfolio_manager My-work zones.

    BA-A3 (21 Aug 2026): 24 -> 25. "Business Architecture" added to this
    role's My work. platform_admin is the default enterprise_role for any
    user who never picked one, so a page limited to the two architect roles
    would be invisible to most real accounts. Rendered total 25 -> 26, still
    under SIDEBAR_LINK_BUDGET (27).

    Phase 0 CI audit (fix/phase0-ci-and-audit): 25 -> 27, measured directly
    rather than reconstructed from history. This pinned assertion and
    role_access.py's SIDEBAR_LINK_BUDGET both went stale when the in-built
    error telemetry commit (10 Sep 2026, e7e36195) added the "Errors" link
    without updating either — caught by CI's `Tests` job, not by review.
    There is a small pre-existing drift beyond just that one link this fix
    does not attempt to unwind; 27 is the actual current count.

    27 -> 28: "Ask a question" added to every persona's My work, platform_admin
    included. It is the only link the Ask and Twin map pages add; the Twin map
    is reached from the Ask page.

    Canvas/framework UI fix, round 2 (25 Sep 2026): stays 28. "Canvases" and
    "Frameworks" join this role's Library zone (+2); "Import History" and
    "Batch Import" fold out of the Admin zone onto the admin dashboard page
    (-2), and Framework Management / Framework Configuration are added to
    that same dashboard page rather than the Admin zone, so they add zero
    here. Net zero.

    28 -> 29: "Approval Inbox" added to every persona's My work, platform_admin
    included. It is a genuinely new, intentional link — the one queue for every
    pending change proposal, shared by every persona with GENERAL permission.

    29 -> 30 (R1-B56, 6 Oct 2026): "Agent Registry" added to platform_admin's
    My work — the one registry recording each agent's owner, charter version
    and delegated limits, closest existing persona to the brief's

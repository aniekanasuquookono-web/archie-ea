"""Real-browser acceptance journeys for the typed ARB governance surface.

These are `typed-arb-ui-blueprint.md` §15 journeys A-G, driven against a live
server, a real database and a real Chromium, as the blueprint requires.

Historical defects and live fail-closed checks
----------------------------------------------
The journeys retain the investigation history below so a regression cannot be
mistaken for an undocumented design choice.  All canonical submission paths
are now hard assertions.  Conditional ``xfail`` calls remain only where a live
browser measurement detects a known legacy fallback defect; a green run has no
expected failures or skips.

  ARB-UI-1  FIXED at integration ce104eb3 - the coordinator wired
            typed_arb_queue_view / typed_arb_review_view into arb_routes
            dashboard() and review_detail(). Journeys A.4, C's UI half and
            D.2 are real assertions again as a result. Original finding:
            The typed governance workspace was never rendered.
            `app/templates/arb/review_detail.html` and `arb/dashboard.html`
            dispatch on a `typed_review` / `typed_queue` context variable
            produced by
            `app.modules.transformation_room.arb_read_models.typed_arb_review_view`
            / `typed_arb_queue_view`. No view function in the tree passes
            either variable — the read model has no caller outside tests. So
            `/arb/` and `/arb/reviews/<id>` always fall through to the LEGACY
            branch, and every §15 assertion about the typed frame (cycle
            number, immutable evidence pin, subject icon/label, condition
            cards, waiver copy, historical-unverified lock, per-actor
            `allowed_actions`) is untestable in a browser.

  ARB-UI-2  §11 requires HTML child routes
            `POST /arb/reviews/<review_item_id>/conditions/<condition_id>/{evidence,verify,waive}`.
            They do not exist. Condition mutation is reachable only through the
            JSON API, which no rendered template calls.

  ARB-UI-3  FIXED. The typed ingress accepts ADR, Architecture Model, Solution,
            and Decision Brief. Journey A constructs a real frozen Decision
            Brief from the production programme, discovery, evidence, option,
            and human-attestation services; no governance prerequisite is
            stubbed.

Three further defects were found by the browser itself, in the pages a user
actually gets today, and are recorded the same way:

  ARB-UI-4  CLOSED on the typed path; LEGACY path only. `/arb/reviews/<id>`
            renders exactly one <nav aria-label="Breadcrumb"> once the typed
            workspace is wired (page_header(breadcrumbs=...) in
            review_detail.html). The original zero-breadcrumb measurement was
            against the LEGACY body, which still emits none.
            NOTE ON HOW THIS WAS GOT WRONG: an interim report claimed this
            survived on the typed path. That was inference from an xfail
            COUNT, not a measurement - the test then had two possible xfail
            exits (this check, and a trailing unconditional ARB-UI-1 xfail),
            so both "breadcrumb missing" and "breadcrumb present" produced the
            same total. Removing the second exit made the check decisive. The
            assertion below is now the only exit, so it cannot recur.
  ARB-UI-5  LEGACY PATH ONLY, resolved on the typed path. The uncaught page
            error ('expected } got ""') at 390px and 1024px did not recur once
            the typed workspace rendered. It is not eliminated - the wiring
            falls back to the legacy body when the read model returns None, so
            the legacy body remains reachable and still carries it.
  ARB-UI-6  LEGACY PATH ONLY, resolved on the typed path. axe reported
            color-contrast (serious) on /arb/ and color-contrast + label
            (critical) on /arb/reviews/<id> against the legacy body; against
            the typed workspace axe returns ZERO violations at both 390px and
            1024px. Same caveat as ARB-UI-5: the legacy fallback still carries
            them, and neither page is in tests/smoke/a11y_baseline.json.

One role-model inconsistency was found while wiring these actors:

  ARB-ROLE-1 Two modules in `app/modules/transformation_room/` define a
            constant named `_SUBMIT_ROLES` with DIFFERENT members.
            `arb_submission_service` uses the eight architect roles plus
            `platform_admin`; `arb_condition_evidence_service` uses
            {chief_architect, enterprise_architect, solution_architect,
            architect, arb_member}. So `platform_admin` may submit an ARB
            subject but may NOT capture condition evidence, and `arb_member`
            is the reverse. Neither asymmetry is stated anywhere. `arb_member`
            is the only seeded archetype that can both submit evidence and
            clear the verification role gate, which is why journey C uses it.

Everything that IS reachable is asserted for real: the typed submission ingress,
idempotency, the typed decision path behind the legacy decision form, the whole
condition evidence/verification/waiver lifecycle, separation of duties, tenancy,
and an axe + overflow + console audit of the ARB pages a user actually gets.

"""Who can reach what: the access matrix, observed rather than assumed.

291 routes carry an explicit role gate. This drives every archetype against the
persona-exclusive sections and asserts the result matches an expectation derived
from the decorators themselves:

    requires_procurement        -> procurement, portfolio_manager  (+ platform_admin)
    requires_application_owner  -> application_manager             (+ platform_admin)
    admin_required              -> platform_admin

platform_admin passes every gate by design - requires_role() grants it
unconditionally - so it is expected to reach all of them.

Why observe instead of reading the decorators: a decorator only tells you what
was intended. It does not tell you whether the blueprint is registered, whether
another route shadows the path, or whether the gate runs before the handler
touches data. Earlier in this codebase a decorator scan reported 1,590 unguarded
mutating routes when the real number was 1, and separately reported an
unauthenticated /api/gdpr/delete that turned out never to be registered. Only
driving it settles either question.

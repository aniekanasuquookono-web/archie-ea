"""Harness for browser smoke journeys.

These render real pages in a real browser against a real database. That matters
because every cheaper layer of verification in this codebase has passed defects
the next layer caught:

  * static analysis passed a front end that never loaded, because the templates
    were valid and only the browser checks integrity hashes
  * route maps passed handlers that 500 on their first row, because an empty
    portfolio never enters the loop
  * HTTP 200 passed a compliance page rendering "Consumed: / Entitled:" with both
    numbers blank, because Jinja prints Undefined as empty string

So the assertions here are deliberately about what a user experiences: does the
page render, does the front end boot, is every control named, does anything
overflow, and does submitted work actually persist and appear where it should.

Skips cleanly when Playwright or a browser is unavailable, so `pytest -q` on a
developer machine is unaffected; CI installs Chromium and runs them for real.

# `package`, not `session`, and the distinction is load-bearing.

# Playwright's sync API drives its asyncio loop from a greenlet that stays parked
# in run_until_complete() for as long as `sync_playwright()` is open. Greenlets
# share the OS thread and asyncio's running-loop marker is thread-global, so from
# the moment the first smoke test asks for `browser`, asyncio._get_running_loop()
# returns Playwright's loop for every test that follows in the process.
#
# Session scope held that context open until the whole run ended. pytest collects
# tests/journeys -> tests/smoke -> tests/test_*.py, so every later module ran
# inside the leaked loop, and tests/test_lucid_import.py:705 — the only
# asyncio.run() in the suite — died with:
#
#     RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop
#
# Package scope finalises the fixture when tests/smoke finishes (it has an
# __init__.py, so it is a Package node), releasing the loop before the rest of the
# suite. Chromium is still launched exactly once — there is one smoke package —
# and it is scope-legal: `audited` is module-scoped and every `page` is
# function-scoped, so no consumer outlives it.
#
# CI passes today only because its `tests` job never runs `playwright install`,
# so the launch raises, the skip below unwinds the context, and the loop is
# released. Adding a browser to that job would have turned it red.

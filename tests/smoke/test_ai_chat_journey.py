"""Browser journey for /ai-chat.

The page had no browser coverage at all — no smoke journey, no authorisation row,
no entry in the a11y baseline — while carrying roughly 2,500 lines of inline
JavaScript. That is how a dead stop button, a composer handoff writing a key
nobody reads, and a sidebar tab that never hid its own panel all shipped
unnoticed: nothing ever loaded the page in a browser and looked.

This file is the instrument the client rebuild is verified against, so its
assertions are deliberately about **transport and DOM**, never about what the
model says. The LLM provider is unconfigured in CI — `/ai-chat/models` returns an
empty list there — and a test that needs a working provider is a test that fails
for reasons unrelated to the code under change, which is how browser suites get
switched off.

Concretely, each assertion is a defect class the rebuild can reintroduce silently:

    page boots          2,500 lines move into modules; one dangling reference
                        and the whole front end stops at the first exception
    console clean       an Alpine expression error is a warning in the console
                        and nothing at all in an HTTP 200
    panels toggle       'history' was missing from switchSidebarTab's list, so
                        picking another tab left the Chats panel on screen
    composer sends      Enter was bound to nothing for a long time; the only way
                        to send was the button, which is also a keyboard trap
    request is issued   the point of the composer is that a request leaves the
                        browser — assert that, not the answer that comes back

    """Clicking a conversation in the rail must put its turns on screen.

    This is the regression test for a real defect. loadSession() guarded its
    render loop with `typeof appendMessage === 'function'` — true while the code
    lived in a classic <script> that hoisted the function onto window, always
    false once it moved into a module IIFE. The loop rendered nothing, inside a
    bare catch, so the pane went blank with no error.

    And blank was the better half: __threadId had already switched, so the next
    message continued a conversation the user could not see.

    Nothing caught it because no test called loadSession — the tab-switching test
    clicks the History tab, which only lists. The thread payload is stubbed so
    this asserts the client render path without needing a configured LLM.

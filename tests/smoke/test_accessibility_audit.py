"""WCAG 2.2 AA audit with axe-core, on the pages each archetype actually uses.

This engagement already closed 939 unlabelled form controls, which was the single
largest defect class in the product. That work was necessary and it is not
sufficient: "every input has a name" is one success criterion out of dozens, and
an EN 301 549 auditor tests the rest too - contrast, landmarks, heading order,
ARIA validity, focus order, link purpose.

axe-core is what those auditors run. It detects roughly a third of WCAG issues
automatically, so a clean result is a floor rather than a certificate - it means
nothing mechanical is wrong, not that the product is usable with a screen reader.
Manual testing is still owed, and this audit does not replace it.

The level is WCAG 2.2 AA as a build-and-test standard, not a conformance claim.
2.2 adds to 2.1 rather than replacing it, so the 2.1 tags stay. Of what 2.2 adds,
axe-core automates exactly one thing: the `target-size` rule (2.5.8, interactive
targets of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels), carried by the `wcag22aa` tag. Focus Not
Obscured, Dragging Movements, Consistent Help, Redundant Entry and Accessible
Authentication have no axe rule and remain manual.

That is why a tag set that says 2.2 is not enough on its own. Naming `wcag22aa`
against an axe-core that predates the rule selects nothing and reports "no 2.2
violations" for a check that never ran. So this module reads the bundled axe-core
version at run time and prints it, and fails if `target-size` is not in the
loaded rule list. Once a browser is available it likewise FAILS, rather than
skips, when axe-playwright-python is not installed (with no browser the whole
tier skips, as tests/smoke/conftest.py arranges): a skipped test reports as
passed, which would let a CI run say "no accessibility violations" when no
accessibility check ran at all.

A clean `target-size` result is narrower than it sounds. The rule also passes a
target smaller than 24 by 24 pixels when enough clear space surrounds it, and
every audited page carries such targets (small links measuring 32 by 16, for
instance), so "clean" does not mean every target is 24 by 24. The audited tenant
also holds only a handful of records, so long lists and busy states are not
exercised. Both are left to manual review.

Gated as a ratchet against an accepted baseline, like the bandit and dependency
gates, for the same reason: a check that fails on day one gets disabled on day
two. Serious violations fail the build immediately; everything else may only
decrease.

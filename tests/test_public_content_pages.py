  AC1 — Every file under content/pages/ returns 200 signed out, title in <title> and <h1>.

# line — the page renders fine for a signed-out visitor, and is simply
# invisible to every crawler.

# real, collects every entelim.org URL any of them names (plus their own

# that the feature each one describes was shipped and reachable. An
# independent review found 4 of the 7 were not: capture_status had been set
# to "live" right alongside cta, so a check that only compares those two
# front-matter fields against each other would have passed all 7 pages,
# including the 4 that were wrong. The actual tell, in every one of the 4
# bad pages, was that nothing in the running app answers the page's own
# url_slug -- the only front-matter field that names a concrete, checkable
# destination. That is what this test verifies, for every module and
# function-per-segment page, via the app's real url_map rather than by
# re-reading the content files a second time.
#
# state: missing is also rejected outright, since a page admitting its own
# feature does not exist yet is never consistent with cta: plans -- see
# uc-s3-15, the one page of the 4 that had this set and still should not
# have needed a route check to catch.

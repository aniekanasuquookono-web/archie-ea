"""Task 3 (p0-wave): a failing LLM must not leave the chat stream silent.

Repro from the live product review: POST /ai-chat/message/stream returned 200
and persisted an assistant message ("The AI request couldn't be completed.
See the error detail below or check Admin -> API Settings.") but the browser
showed nothing for 15s+ - no typing indicator, no error bubble.

AgentRunner._fallback() (app/modules/ai_chat/services/agent_runner.py) already
does the right thing on the server: when the LLM call raises, it returns a
dict carrying BOTH a friendly `response` message AND the raw `error` reason.
chat_core.py's streaming route spreads that whole dict onto the SSE `done`
event unchanged. The bug this wave fixes was entirely in the browser
(app/static/js/ai_chat/transport.js unconditionally threw away the `response`
text whenever `error` was present, instead of rendering it) - but that
client behaviour can't be exercised from a server-side test.

What this file pins instead is the server-side half of the contract the
client fix depends on: given an LLM client that raises, the SSE stream for
/ai-chat/message/stream must actually carry a `done` event with a non-empty,
human-readable `response` (the message the UI is now supposed to render) and
the `error` field naming what went wrong. If a future change makes
AgentRunner swallow the LLM error into an empty response, or chat_core stop
forwarding `error`, this goes red before the browser regresses silently
again.

"""Regression: as-is/to-be plateau tagging must be readable back, not write-only.

A Capgemini delivery-team dry-run (2 Sep 2026) found that tagging an ArchiMate
element Baseline/Target/Transition through the create/edit form (which writes
ArchiMateElement.togaf_plateau, a real column) silently could not be found again:
GET /api/layer/<layer>/elements never serialized a "plateau" key at all, and the
client-side filter (dashboard.js) additionally read the WRONG key
(properties.plateau, a JSON blob the form never wrote to) with a mismatched
vocabulary (current/transitional/target vs. the real Baseline/Target/Transition).
Tagging worked; finding what you tagged did not. Both the API and the client
filter are fixed; this pins the API half, which is what the client-side fix
depends on.

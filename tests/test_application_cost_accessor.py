"""Tests for the Application Cost Accessor.

Covers:
- Single accessor for annual cost (get_annual_cost, set_annual_cost)
- Cost cell parsing with currency, period, category
- Import column mapping and typed preview
- Unparseable cells reported and imported as empty (never 0)
- Tenant isolation: cost visible only to owning organisation

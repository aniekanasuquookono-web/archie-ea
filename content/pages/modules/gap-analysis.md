# Gap Analysis

*The register of what's missing between today's estate and the target state — the record the
Roadmaps page's gap timeline is built from.*

## What this module does

Where Roadmaps shows the stage-by-stage picture, Gap Analysis is the underlying register: each gap
named, tracked, and linked to the projects closing it. One source both the standard roadmap view and
the tech-lead view read from, so they never disagree about what's actually missing.

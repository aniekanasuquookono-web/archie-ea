# Compliance Frameworks

*Records where each application in your model stands against every framework's controls —
what's implemented, what's still a gap.*

## What this module does

Records, per application, where it stands against each framework's controls. It shows what your
own model's data says against a framework's requirements — never a certification or a guarantee
that you pass an audit.

# Duplicate Detection

*The engine behind Rationalization — finds two applications doing the same job before you go looking
for them.*

## What this module does

Scans your application list for functional overlap and surfaces candidates automatically, feeding
straight into the Rationalization dashboard and a consolidation list. This is the detection step;
Rationalization is where you act on what it finds.

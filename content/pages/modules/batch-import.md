# Batch Import

*Spreadsheets and full architecture exports, all landing in the same model — with a full import
history.*

## What this module does

Whatever format your existing data is in, it comes in here: a spreadsheet of people and suppliers,
or a full architecture export from another tool. Import history keeps a record of exactly what came
in and when.

## Where you'll meet it

- [Import our existing model](/use-cases/import-archimate-model)
- [Set it up from our spreadsheet in an afternoon](/use-cases/set-up-in-an-afternoon)

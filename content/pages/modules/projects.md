# Projects

*Dates, status, and estimated versus actual cost for every project — with cost shown as genuinely
absent when it hasn't been entered, not defaulted to zero.*

## What this module does

Every project tied to a wider initiative, with what it's meant to touch, whether it's on schedule,
and what it's actually costing against what was estimated. A project with no cost recorded shows
plainly that nothing has been entered, never a silent zero that makes an underfunded initiative look
on-budget.
